"Young Readers: Reviews of Musnet, Bird Boy Vol. 1, and Poppy! and the Lost Lagoon","This month, Gwen and Andy take listeners on a worldwide tour featuring adventures of various cultures in three books: Musnet: The Mouse of Monet by Kickliy (Uncivilized Books/Odod), Anne Szabla’s Bird Boy Volume 1: The Sword of Mali Mahi (Dark Horse Books), and Poppy! and the Lost Lagoon by Matt Kindt and Brian Hurtt (Dark Horse Books).
 Before they get to the books, Andy and Gwen both regret not being able to attend HeroesCon, but Gwen gives a brief (and very interesting) report from her recent experience at the Children’s Literature Association Conference in Columbus, Ohio. Who knows? Maybe the Two People with PhDs Talking about Comics for Young Readers will both be there next year?
 Gwen and Andy are always excited to see more comics translated into English, and Kickliy’s Musnet: The Mouse of Monet is now available in French and English editions. Both enjoyed the leisurely storytelling and the wonderful use of color in this story of a mouse named Mus who longs to paint like a master artist. This first volume of a projected four-volume series introduces us to Mus’s world in Giverny, France, his teacher, his new friend Mya, and the world of painting. This book will appeal especially to young readers (ages 8 and up) who show an interest not just in painting, but in any of the arts. The look and pace of the book may take some getting used to for young readers, especially if this is their first venture into European comics, but the venture is certainly worth taking.
 Next, Gwen and Andy discuss Bird Boy Volume 1: The Sword of Mali Mahi, which began (and continues) as a webcomic by Anne Szabla. This book (suggested for ages 8-12) contains familiar elements of quest/adventure stories, yet it has the feel of something both fresh and ancient. Szabla combines elements of myth and legend from a great many sources -- Mayan, Norse, Northwest Native American, etc. -- to tell the story of Bali, a 10-year-old boy desperate to prove his worth to his tribe despite being small in stature. Although considered too little to participate in an important coming-of-age ceremony, Bali takes matters into his own hands and discovers a dangerous secret that’s been kept hidden for ages.
 Gwen and Andy love the story and can’t say enough about the fabulous art and use of color, yet they wish that the creator and publisher had given readers some information about the cultural influences reflected in the book. (Perhaps they will in the second volume, which comes out later this summer.) Still, Bird Boy is an exciting, unique new series that the two look forward to exploring further.
 Finally, Gwen and Andy could not stop singing the praises of Poppy! and the Lost Lagoon by Matt Kindt and Brian Hurtt. Although suggested for ages 8-12, this is a book that can be enjoyed and appreciated by much older readers...even those with PhDs! Ten-year-old Poppy Pepperton and her legal guardian Colt Winchester are explorers working for a 4,000-year-old Egyptian pharaoh with the body of an eight-year-old boy. The pharaoh sends Poppy and Colt on an adventure that would make Indiana Jones think twice, a story filled with danger, mystery, riddles, puzzles, a flying carpet, a mummy head that talks, a creature called a gigantipus, and more!
 Poppy! is truly a book of wonder, reflected not only in characters we quickly come to love and care about, but also in its fantastic art and glorious use of watercolor. And although Poppy! is an enormously entertaining book filled with humor, it also speaks to issues of the environment and the preservation of natural habitats without getting preachy or didactic. It’s pretty safe to say this is one of Gwen and Andy’s favorite books so far in 2016.

"Terence Crawford vs Raymundo Beltran Post Fight Review","Terence Crawford (25-0, 17 KOs) the Omaha, Nebraskan native put on a dominating performance in front of his home crowd, to retain his WBO light welterweight title. Given the fact his opponent was Raymundo Beltran (29-7, 17 KOs), one of the top fighters in the lightweight division, Crawford’s masterful performance certainly makes him a top contender for fighter of the year honors. 

Tyson Fury now improves his undefeated record (23-0, 17 KOs) by stopping the overly matched Dereck Chisora (20-5, 13 KOs). The mismatch was evident from the opening bell.

Fury used his height and reach to keep Chisora at a distance, and constantly peppered him with jabs, and combinations from the outside.

Billy Joe Saunders (21-0, 11 Kos) gets a hard fought split decision victory over Chris Eubank Jr. (18-1, Kos 13). In boxing there is nothing more exciting than two young undefeated fighters in their prime, giving it their all, and that’s what happened in the Excel Arena.

In the first half of the fight Saunders and Eubank Jr. got into a technical fight, both trying to measure and outwit each other. Eubank Jr. is a decent boxer, but was clearly outmatched from a technical standpoint by Saunders. We will with out a shadow of a doubt be taking live calls on air from you the voice of the people.

"Mind Benders: March 2014 (no images)","In this episode of SFMOMA Artcasts we take a turn toward the conceptual. We begin with an excerpt from a Norton Lecture presented at Harvard University in 1988 by experimental composer, music theorist, and artist John Cage. Cage reflects on the process of writing his unprecedented silent piece 4'33"" (1952) and explains what he admires about the composition. Next, artist Tom Marioni discusses Drinking Beer with Friends Is the Highest Form of Art, a conceptual performance he first staged in 1970, and considers the ways it reflects his philosophy on life. In the final segment, artist Mel Bochner describes his use of carpenters chalk to solve the problems posed in idea-based artwork. Both Marioni and Bochner reflect on Cage's innovations and consider the ways his work impacted their own.

Each SFMOMA Artcast brings you illuminating audio and video interviews with artists, curators, and visitors as they respond to the works on view and in the museum's collection."

"Bad at Sports Episode 332: Michael Darling and Naomi Beckwith","This week: The second installment of our pirate radio sessions, recorded live from NADA 2011! We are joined by local heroes The Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago curators Michael Darling and Naomi Beckwith.





Naomi Beckwith is a curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. Beckwith joined the curatorial staff in May 2011. A native Chicagoan, Beckwith grew up in Hyde Park and attended Lincoln Park High School, going on to receive a BA in history from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. She completed an MA with Distinction from the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, presenting her master's thesis on Adrian Piper and Carrie Mae Weems.

Afterward, she was a Helena Rubenstein Critical Studies Fellow at the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program in New York. Beckwith was a fall 2008 grantee of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and was named the 2011 Leader to Watch by ArtTable. She serves on the boards of the Laundromat Project (New York) and Res Artis (Amsterdam).

Prior to joining the MCA staff, Beckwith was associate curator at The Studio Museum in Harlem. Preceding her tenure at the Studio Museum, Beckwith was the Whitney Lauder Curatorial Fellow at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, where she worked on numerous exhibitions including Locally Localized Gravity (2007), an exhibition and program of events presented by more than 100 artists whose practices are social, participatory, and communal.

Beckwith has also been the BAMart project coordinator at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and a guest blogger for Art21. She has curated and co-curated exhibitions at New York alternative spaces Recess Activities, Cuchifritos, and Artists Space.

Beckwith curated the exhibition 30 Seconds off an Inch, which was presented by the Studio Museum in Harlem November 12, 2009 – March 14, 2010.  Exhibiting artworks by 42 artists of color or those inspired by black culture from more than 10 countries, the show asked viewers to think about ways in which social meaning is embedded formally within artworks.

 

Michael Darling (born 1968) is the James W. Alsdorf Chief Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (MCA). Darling joined the MCA staff in July 2010.


Darling received his BA in art history from Stanford University, and he received his MA and PhD in art and architectural history from the University of California, Santa Barbara. Darling has worked as an independent writer and curator, contributing essays on art, architecture, and design to publications including Frieze, Art Issues, Flash Art, and LA Weekly. Darling frequently serves as a panelist, lecturer, and guest curator on contemporary art and architecture.

Prior to joining the MCA, Darling was the Jon and Mary Shirley Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Seattle Art Museum (SAM), where he was awarded SAM's Patterson Sims Fellowship for 2009-10. In 2008, Darling began the program SAM Next, a series of contemporary art exhibitions presenting emerging or underappreciated artists from around the globe. Artist Enrico David, who exhibited as part of SAM Next, has since been nominated for the Turner Prize.

Darling curated the SAM exhibitions Target Practice: Painting Under Attack 1949-78 (June 25 – September 7, 2009), and Kurt (May 13 – September 16, 2010). Target Practice showcased the attacks painting underwent in the years following World War II. Kurt explored Kurt Cobain’s influence on contemporary artists.


Darling was associate curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, before joining SAM. He co-curated The Architecture of R.M. Schindler (2001), which won the International Association of Art Critics “Best Architecture or Design Exhibition” award. The exhibition also won merit awards for interior architecture from the Southern California American Institute of Architects and the California Council of the American Institute of Architects.

"CW 736 FBF - American Demography from Baby Boomers to Generation Y with Ken Gronbach Author of ‘Age Curve’","Many demographic changes are taking place, with the Baby Boomers, a large generation, retiring, and Generation Y, a larger generation than the Baby Boomers, consuming at record levels.  Join Jason Hartman and demographer, Ken Gronbach, as they discuss this upcoming “storm.”
 Ken describes Generation Y as an exciting generation, where the United States is the only country with this large of a group at the present time, and that it is very important that businesses recognize and anticipate their markets as Generation Y grows up. Generation X is more of a mystery generation because of its smaller size, which makes it less of a valuable market.  Ken believes that the United States’ best days are ahead as people bail out of the European Union. He also believes that China’s economic future is bleak due to artificial tampering with the population, with demographic numbers showing China in trouble economically within ten years, struggling to feed themselves within 15 years.
 Ken shows how the housing market is being held hostage by big bank foreclosures and why this log jam will soon correct and precipitate a restoration of the United States economy. Ken also talks about how manufacturing will return to the United States with a vengeance because the United States is the only industrialized nation with a huge young highly skilled workforce.
 Kenneth W. Gronbach is a gifted keynote speaker and a nationally recognized expert and futurist in the field of Demography and Generational Marketing. Ken entertains his audiences with his own special brand of wit, humor and clear communication. He makes the science of shifting demography come alive with real life examples that make it relevant to today’s culture, business climate and economy.  In his book “Age Curve, How to Profit from the Coming Demographic Storm”, published by The American Management Association, Ken takes you through a fascinating common sense understanding of shifting demography and the related opportunities and challenges. The demographic landscape in the United States is made up a series of waves that are about twenty years in duration.
 It would follow that business will rise and fall according to the critical mass of customers heading toward it. Ken’s latest book “Decades of Difference, Making it Work” (HRD Press), about the United States workforce, was released in October 2010. Ken also writes for the CNBC Guest Blog.
 Ken’s perspective is macro, a view from 30,000 feet, and very big picture. Demographers are able to forecast markets, societal phenomena, and economics with uncanny accuracy because they count people, not money or things. For example crime has been down in the United States for the last twenty years because the number of high risk crime committers (men 15 to 30 years old) has been low and fully employed.
 This is because the fertility in the United States dipped sharply between 1965 and 1984 creating a deficit in our population of about nine million people. This shortage of young people in the labor force also drove labor costs up and manufacturing off shore. Ken says the Age Curve will change the way businesses market to consumers and that a sea of entrepreneurial business starts will rule as the economy turns around.

"How a Side Project Turns into a Career - with Kirby Ferguson","Kirby Ferguson created the viral documentary Everything is a Remix in his spare time, just as a little side project outside of his day job. After the instant buzz it received, Kirby was able to leverage his side project into a full-fledged career as a film-maker and video producer. 
 In this episode we’ll hear from Kirby on how the idea for Everything is a Remix first surfaced, then we’ll see how the success of that project turned into its own business, and then we’ll use his story to extract tips on how one should balance the work once we’ve turned a passion into an occupation.
 Kirby's new project is called This is Not a Conspiracy Theory, and it's superb! Check it out.

"Parenting: All Joy and No Fun with Jennifer Senior","Waking up to realize that you are a parent…in charge of another human being’s life…is typically a pretty life-altering experience. And while our Facebook feeds show much of the joyful, silly, happy and proud sides of being a parent, what we seldom admit to ourselves, let alone to our social circles is that parenting is hard and not always a lot of fun.


My guest today is Jennifer Senior, author of the much acclaimed book All Joy and No Fun, named one of Slate’s Top 10 Books of the Year which I can almost guarantee will make you feel about 6 degrees closer to sanity because it is such an honest, fascinating look at modern parenting.

"The Nicest Guy You Don't Want to Mess With: Donovan Green","This week on The Urban Monk Pedram Shojai welcomes a man he met when he appeared on The Dr. Oz Show, Donovan Green. He's a certified ACE and IFA personal trainer, a black belt martial artist, a kick boxing instructor, an integrative nutritionist, and author the book No Excuses Fitness. Donovan is also Dr. Oz's personal trainer! It's hard to imagine that he grew up in a tough part of the Bronx. How did a young man growing up in the Bronx in the mid-1980s amidst the crack epidemic tough it out, resist the peer pressure, and get into the world of fitness? On top of all of that, he wasn't a fit child. How did fitness become a passion for Donovan? Now that he's a very fit person, is training and teaching still a passion for Donovan? How can someone struggling with their environment break through to find their own path to success?

"The Young Turks - 9.30.15: McCarthy, Planned Parenthood, Drone App, and Saudi Prince","A portion of our Young Turks Main Show from September 30, 2015. For more go to http://www.tytmembership.com.

Rep Kevin McCarthy is gearing up for a run to become the next Speaker, so he went on Hannity’s show to prove his Conservative accolades. Video of McCarthy claiming that the Benghazi Committee was put together to tear down Hillary Clinton’s campaign, and he’s on board for that kind of leadership. During the Planned Parenthood hearing, Rep Grothman asked what the purpose is of Planned Parenthood since as a guy, he can go anywhere for healthcare. Bernie Sanders spoke out about how Pres Obama took too long to realize that the GOP hates him and will never work with him. John is comforted by Sanders recognizing the atmosphere, since Obama didn’t. Jeb Bush spoke with an NFL show on SiriusXM and voiced his support for the Redskins name. Video of his answer, claiming that Native American tribes don’t find it offensive, either. Coincidentally, Redskins owner Dan Snyder recently gave $100,000 to the Super PAC that supports Jeb.

Ana joins Ben for SCS. Apple app store has rejected an app called Drones Plus, that shows areas where drone strikes have happened. Apple claimed it was excessively crude, unentertaining, or objectionable content. 8 players from Iran’s female soccer team are being accused of being men posing as women. Iran is very open to gender reassignment surgery and trans issues. Ben isn’t buying that these players are transgender women, but simply men being put on the team as ringers. Discussion about the potential of this becoming an issue in American sports. The Saudi prince accused of raping a woman in his Beverly Hills home has posted the $300K bail and flew out of the country on a private jet. Ana doesn’t think it’s likely that he’ll return to face the rape charges.

"TLS #171: How to Get out of Fear and Back into Flow + Alignment With Gabby Bernstein","Today’s Lively Show is with a special guest I’ve looked forward to having on the show since we started, Gabby Bernstein.

Gabby is a spiritual teacher, best-selling author, and youtuber with a new book out called The Universe Has Your Back - which is a perfect compliment to what we’ve been discussing here on the show this summer about finding flow and alignment.

In the episode, we’ll be talking about Gabby’s favorite tools and techniques to get back into love, flow, and alignment whenever fear takes over.

This episode is perfect for anyone looking for strategies to help quickly move out of fear and get back into flow, alignment, and love on a moment-to-moment basis.









[Tweet ""“The presence of fear is a sure sign that you are trusting your own strength."" - @GabbyBernstein""]
[Tweet ""“Take action from a surrendered place."" - @GabbyBernstein""]
[Tweet ""“Where your attention goes your energy flows."" - @GabbyBernstein""]
[Tweet ""“Our presence is our greatest source of power."" - @GabbyBernstein""]


IN THIS EPISODE YOU’LL FIND OUT ABOUT
 

  Gabby tells us about how she began her career by running a PR business but that fast-paced life pushed her to the point of burn-out.


  She talks about how she was deeply embedded in the NYC party scene and how that lifestyle, drugs and alcohol did not help her find the happiness she was seeking.


  Gabby digs deeper about her struggles with drugs and alcohol and how that led her to a big crash in her life and how that low point helped her reevaluate what she was doing in her life and that she needed change.

She describes how a recent breakdown allowed her to remember a childhood trauma which helped produce some of the reasons and answers to her addictions.


Gabby talks about how taking action from a surrendered place is how we truly manifest our desires into form.


She describes how she focused her energy into what was thriving rather than what was lacking to place herself in a place spiritual surrender.


Gabby mentions how important it is to be the positive influence, the positive force, so that this energy will shine on you and the world around you.


Gabby describes the feeling  she experiences when she is channeling a spirit.

  She shares her belief why there is a misconception that pain has purpose.

"Ars Technicast, Episode 4 – The science and the fiction of Prometheus","This week we devote the show to science fiction, and in particular Ridley Scott’s new film Prometheus. Warning: This show is extremely spoiler heavy, so if you don’t want to know details about the film, wait until you see it first, since we give away major plot points. 



Ridley’ Scott’s loose prequel to his 1979 film Alien provides fertile ground to discuss the fiction and storytelling used in the film, but the movie has very little science that can be compared to science in the real world. We also discuss how the scientists aboard the Prometheus don’t behave like actual scientists. No discussion of this series of films is complete without talking about the monsters. Does the creature design of Prometheus work with previous films in the Alien series? Tune in to find out. Host Senior Apple Editor Jacqui Cheng is joined by Open Source Editor Ryan Paul, Social Editor Cesar Torres and Ars Contributor Casey Johnston.

We also talk about the Olympics and the Andrew Bynum cameo at Friday's game."

"In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto by Michael Pollan (an audiobook excerpt)","The first thing to understand about nutritionism is that it is not the same thing as nutrition. As the “-ism” suggests, it is not a scientific subject but an ideology. Ideologies are ways of organizing large swaths of life and experience under a set of shared but unexamined assumptions. This quality makes an ideology particularly hard to see, at least while it’s still exerting its hold on your culture. A reigning ideology is a little like the weather—all pervasive and so virtually impossible to escape. Still, we can try. In the case of nutritionism, the widely shared but unexamined assumption is that the key to understanding food is indeed the nutrient. Put another way: Foods are essentially the sum of their nutrient parts. From this basic premise flow several others.
 Today's featured book is In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto by Michael Pollan, the author of the bestselling The Omnivore's Dilemma, Cooked, Food Rules, and many others. It's a thoughtful and thorough look at the modern food industry - dominated by the ideology of nutritionism - why it's bad for us, and how we got there.

The goal of each episode is to teach you something you didn't know, or to tell a story, and give you an accurate feel for that particular audiobook.

Featured authors include Malcolm Gladwell, Ernest Hemingway, Jared Diamond, Ralph Waldo Emerson, David Foster Wallace and many more. There will be at least one or two new books every week!
 Here's a curated  Amazon store including every audiobook featured on this podcast. You can preview and buy the audiobooks there.

 Today's featured book is In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto by Michael Pollan, the author of the bestselling The Omnivore's Dilemma, Cooked, Food Rules, and many others. It's a thoughtful and thorough look at the modern food industry - dominated by the ideology of nutritionism - why it's bad for us, and how we got there.

"In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto by Michael Pollan (an audiobook excerpt)","The first thing to understand about nutritionism is that it is not the same thing as nutrition. As the “-ism” suggests, it is not a scientific subject but an ideology. Ideologies are ways of organizing large swaths of life and experience under a set of shared but unexamined assumptions. This quality makes an ideology particularly hard to see, at least while it’s still exerting its hold on your culture. A reigning ideology is a little like the weather—all pervasive and so virtually impossible to escape. Still, we can try. In the case of nutritionism, the widely shared but unexamined assumption is that the key to understanding food is indeed the nutrient. Put another way: Foods are essentially the sum of their nutrient parts. From this basic premise flow several others.

"64: Jimmy Graham trade, Marshawn Lynch signs extension, Geoff Baker interview","The news about the Jimmy Graham trade to the Seahawks breaks as we sit down to record the show. Fortunately, technical difficulties (technically the show we recorded Monday just wasn't very good) allowed us to talk about some Seahawks news that just couldn't have waited another week. Brandan helps break down what the Seahawks may have been thinking in going after Jimmy Graham and what he means to this team inside the Red Zone.

News of Marshawn Lynch extending his contract for two additional years was a highlight this past week. With a three-year deal now on the books, it looks likely that he'll remain with the Seahawks for the rest of his career and eventually earn him a spot on the team's Ring of Honor. The guys talk about other free agent news, including a look at our division rivals as every team except the Niners seems to be improving in some way.

Geoff Baker, investigative reporter for the Seattle Times, visits the show to talk about two stories since the Super Bowl about fans who either went through well known ticket sites or purchased ""options"" to buy tickets at face value. He talks about why prices rose to an artificially high rate and why some fans might have been willing to pay extraordinary prices to salvage the weekend.

The guys shout out to some fellow podcasters in the final segment, announce the new Sea Hawkers Podcast app in the Amazon app store, and offer their ""Do Better"" nods. Richard Sherman and Russell Wilson are Brandan's ""Better at Life"" picks, while John Schneider gets Adam's vote for pulling off a trade nobody saw coming.

"Abedin, Weiner separating after new sexting allegations, Gene Wilder, star of 'Willy Wonka,' dead at 83, Colin Kaepernick Protesting Anthem Despite the Cost","Longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin announced Monday that she and former US Rep. Anthony Weiner are separating after new reports surfaced that he sent sexually suggestive photos again.

""After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband. Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy,"" Abedin said in a statement Monday.
Abedin was ""furious and sickened"" by the picture of Weiner and their 4-year-old son, Jordan, according to two people close to the family. The sources said she did not know about it or details of the latest sexting exchange until this weekend.
Weiner, who torpedoed his own political career five years ago with a sexting scandal and whose wife is Clinton's closest adviser, deleted his Twitter account after the latest report surfaced.
A Donald Trump supporter told the New York Post that the two of them exchanged racy photos over the course of about a year, including one exchange where she alleges that he sexted her with his son apparently sleeping next to him.

Gene Wilder, star of 'Willy Wonka,' dead at 83.

Gene Wilder, who brought a wild-eyed desperation to a series of memorable and iconic comedy roles in the 1970s and 1980s, has died, his lawyer, Eric Weissmann, said.

He was 83.
Wilder is best known for his collaborations with director Mel Brooks, starring as the stressed-out Leo Bloom in Brooks' breakout 1967 film ""The Producers"" and later in the monster movie spoof ""Young Frankenstein."" He also portrayed a boozing gunslinger in ""Blazing Saddles.""
For many people, Wilder might be best remembered for ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" playing the mysterious candy tycoon in the 1971 adaptation of Roald Dahl's book.
In a statement to CNN on Monday, Brooks called Wilder ""one of the truly great talents of our time.""
""He blessed every film we did with his magic and he blessed me with his friendship,"" Brooks wrote."

"174: Miles Morales, Ultimate Spider-Man!","When Peter Parker died in the Ultimate Universe, a young person of color was there to continue his legacy. Miles Morales would initially be a polarizing character in comics, but with his new take on the mantle, as well as his well written stories he has become embraced by many fans.

"Plyler and Public Ruin","In the early 80’s, Nobel winning economist Milton Friedman wrote,  The Tyranny of the Status Quo.   It was the provocative title of a book which pointed to the enduring power of bureaucrats to stay in power and of rent-seeking politicians to resist even the best thought out remedies—for rent-seeking politicians.

This week, after Obamacrats distributed thousands of DACA kids (Deferred  Action for Childhood Arrivals) to school districts around the country, almost every pol and pundit repeated the same conventional wisdom—that it is federal law which entitles  the children of illegals to a free, tax-funded public education.

Not once was that assumption challenged, by anybody.   In fact, almost every form of media repeated the same refrain.  USA Today, “All children are entitled to a free public education regardless of legal status.” 

A Fox news anchor talked to a lawyer from the National School Board Association who said, “First of all, public schools  all across the country are keenly aware  that they have a legal obligation to educate all children, including immigrant children  regardless of their legal status.”

Bill O’Reilly, along with one of  his token liberal “experts”   bloviated, “…this is according to federal law which states every child in America regardless of their immigrant status is entitled…to equal access to a basic public education…”    Bill intoned, “…the important thing is that every child on American soil is entitled...”   “…the Supreme Court ruled on that.” said the attorney in a burst of late interview honesty.

The only problem with all of these authoritative statements is that they are all wrong.  There is NO federal law which says, “All children in the United States are entitled to equal access to a public education…regardless of their or their parent’s…immigration status.”  

This “law” is really an opinion of a 5-4 “vote” of SCOTUS in 1982 which mysteriously “found” that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was violated if Texas taxpayers didn’t want to pay for the education of Mexican kids.  Plyler vs. Doe.

 Upon that split opinion has this whole edifice been built.  That opinion was conveyed as law, binding on all states even though this was only a Texas lawsuit.   In my home state, on the Iowa Department of Education website, “Plyer is still controlling law today for all states.”

Even at the time, the dissenting opinion, written by Chief Justice Warren Burger, joined by Rehnquist, White and O’Conner, nailed it.  “In an effort to become an omnipotent problem solver, the court distorts our constitutional function…and …illegal aliens have NO right whatever to be here, and the state may reasonably, and constitutionally, elect not to provide them with government services at the expense of those who are lawfully in the state.” 

Plyler has cost taxpayers billions upon billions of unaccountable spending, rewarding all the usual suspects—teachers unions, federally funded ESL programs, immigration activists, and Hispanic political racialists.     Plus, it has created a vast moral hazard which attracts even more illegals with the promise of easy access to OPM.   And it has funded an army of educrats who feed upon the problems they helped generate—with the promise to finally fix stuff IF we can get them just  a little more OPM.

That pundits insist upon referring to Plyler as “law” and that the political class has a vested interest in maintaining the scam IS the “tyranny of the status quo”. 

Those of us who understand the hustle should upon every occasion insist upon reminding educrats, bureaucrats, and immicrats  (I just coined that word…meaning government activists who feed upon the illegal immigration chaos of their own making) of several points.

1.     Judges don’t make law.   You have to be a Harvard Law grad to believe they do.

2.  Opinions of SCOTUS aren’t law.   Article VI, Section 2 of the US  Constitution lists three things as the “supreme law of the land.”   (1) This constitution: (2) The laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance of it;  and (3) All treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States.    You’ll search in vain to find “court opinions” listed as law in the Constitution.

3   Courts can’t raise taxes or tell congress how to or upon what they must   spend money.

4.      A SCOTUS opinion which is unconstitutional should be resisted at every level.  

5.     If ever there was a 10th Amendment case for “nullification” it is Plyler. 

6.     DACA presents a crisis which should not go to waste.

“I do not charge the judges with willful and ill-intentioned error; but honest error must be arrested where its toleration leads to public ruin.”   Jefferson

I'll dive into the specifics today with the help of Sharyl Attkisson and her piece from sharylattkisson.com.

"How does sluggish internet affect business?","The government has come under fire for not investing in the UK's telecoms industry heavily enough.

In the Autumn Statement last year, Philip Hammond announced a £1 billion windfall to boost digital connectivity.

But telecoms expert and the owner of Equinox consulting, Dave Millett. says it's too little too late. He explained to Share's James Brydges the problems that businesses in the UK faced when confronted with slow internet connections."
"Milhaud at West Point","In the opinion of General George Washington, a commanding plateau on the west bank of the Hudson River, about 40 miles north of New York City, was a key strategic position during America’s War for Independence. Washington selected Thaddeus Kosciuszko,* one of the heroes of the Battle of Saratoga, to design fortifications there in 1778, and transferred his headquarters to this “West Point” in 1779. In 1802, after America’s independence had been won, President Thomas Jefferson signed legislation establishing a United States Military Academy at West Point.

150 years later, in 1952, the West Point Military Band decided to observe the Academy’s Sesquicentennial by asking prominent composers to write celebratory works to mark the occasion. A number of composers responded, including the French composer Darius Milhaud. Milhaud’s “West Point Suite” was premiered by the West Point Band at Carnegie Hall on today’s date in 1952, with Captain Francis Resta conducting, and proved to be one of the most successful and oft-performed of these Sesquicentennial pieces.

The previous year, Milhaud had paid a visit to West Point to hear the band, as he wanted to assess both their size and ability. He was impressed by what he heard—and surprised as well when the band struck up “Happy Birthday” in his honor. It seems that both Milhaud and his wife had completely forgotten that their September 4th visit coincided with the composer’s 60th birthday!"

Waiting for Trump to Revive Veteran Affairs. @FRoseDC. @MaryKissel

Washington, November 10 – As the 2016 election cycle moves into full swing, four experts from the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) have released a new report, ""Passing the Baton: A Bipartisan 2016 Agenda for the Veteran and Military Community.” The authors of the report – CNAS Military, Veterans, and Society Program Director Phillip Carter, CNAS Adjunct Fellow Jason Dempsey, CNAS Bacevich Fellow Katherine Kidder, and CNAS Research Assistant Amy Schafer – lay out a comprehensive overview of issues facing the veteran and military community and a plan with substantive recommendations for how the next President can best serve the veteran and military community.

Key recommendations of the report include:
• Continued focus by the next administration on immediate issues such as access to health care, transition to civilian employment, and support to veterans in crisis (like those facing homelessness or legal problems).
• Structural reform of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to better serve veterans, including better alignment of the VA’s resources and requirements.
• Expanded data sharing between the government, private, and non-profit sectors that enables needs assessment, resource allocation, and future planning.
• Elimination of barriers to public-private-nonprofit partnerships that could help veterans better succeed in civilian life.
• Identification of normative outcomes, and rigorous evaluation of how p ublic, private and nonprofit programs perform against these outcomes.
""The 2016 elections will mark a watershed moment for the veteran and military community,"" said Phillip Carter, CNAS Senior Fellow and one of the report's authors. ""This report outlines the critical issues and strategic issues facing this community as the nation ends two major wars, wrestles with an age of fiscal austerity, and enters a presidential election that will set the course of policy for this community and the nation.""

“Policies related to the care of our military, veterans and their families have far-reaching effects, not only on the government agencies providing care, but the entire private/public sector which must address any gaps in services,” said Anne Marie Dougherty, executive director of the Bob Woodruff Foundation which helped fund the report. “This report not only creates a dialogue as we look to elect our next Commander in Chief, it’s the first of its kind to comprehensively breakdown the demographics and issues facing today’s veterans.”

The link to the full report is available below:
http://www.cnas.org/passing-the-baton

Please find the Executive Summary of the report below:

On January 20, 2017, a new U.S. president will take the oath of office. At that moment, he or she will assume responsibility, as commander in chief of the armed forces, for the nation’s 2.4 million active and reserve service members and their 3 million family members. The next president will also inherit the task of supporting the nation’s 21 million veterans – a diverse population that has served presidents stretching back to Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

The next president, like those before, will have to grapple with a military that remains forward-deployed and engaged in myriad theaters against a broad array of threats. The needs of the active and reserve force, their families, and the veteran population continue, even as an age of fiscal austerity grips the federal government and affects the ability of federal agencies to serve the veteran and military community. At the same time, demographic, social, economic, and geographic change within the veteran and military community will continue, or even accelerate in some cases, changing the profile for this community.

This paper outlines a bipartisan agenda for the next administration to support the veteran and military community – to serve it as well as it has served the nation. Regardless of who takes office in January 2017, the issues facing this community will continue, and they will become the responsibility of the next president. The key findings and recommendations of this agenda include:
• Urgent and immediate issues. This set of issues includes those critical concerns facing the military and veteran community about which there is mostly political consensus, both on the problems and solutions. Transition, economic opportunity, health care access, and mental health provision, as well as support to veterans in crisis like those facing homelessness. No matter who wins in 2016, these issues will demand the next president’s attention and require immediate action (or effective continuance of current efforts) and signaling of dedicated oversight from the first day of the next administration.
• Operational issues. A combination of factors – from demographic change within the veteran community to pressure from federal budget fights – has exposed fissures, gaps, and tension points within the system that serves the veteran and military community. These include such issues as access to veterans’ health care reform and benefits support, reform of the military personnel system, and connection of the military to society. On these matters, some agreement exists as to the nature or scope of the problems, but there is sharp disagreement on how to address them. These issues deserve attention from the next president; however, the election will likely determine their priority and what answers the next administration favors.
• Strategic opportunities. Beyond the specific policy choices to be made by the next administration, there are a number of steps that can be taken by public-, private-, and nonprofit-sector leaders to continue momentum from the past 15 years of sup- port for the veteran and military community. These include opportunities to better share data inside and outside of government, use data to make better decisions affecting this community, and expand public-private-nonprofit partnerships to better serve the nation.
In addition to these points, this paper outlines a “first 100 days” agenda for the next president to immediately signal his/her commitment to the veteran and military community and take those necessary first steps to enable subsequent success. These steps include establishment of White House priorities and staff for this area, appointment and confirmation of key agency leaders, development of budget submissions to fully support this community, and early statements of administration policy on key issues such as funding priorities and the value of public-private partnerships.

Effective support for the veteran and military community matters for many reasons. National security depends on the United States’ ability to recruit, retain, manage, and support its service members and their families. Most veterans do well after service, but some struggle, often needing support to tackle health, economic, and wellness challenges that impede their transition to civilian life. The government has a sacred trust with its veterans to help with these challenges and support private- and nonprofit-sector efforts to help too. The nation benefits from the successful transition and future success of veterans in myriad ways, including the contributions these veterans make to society after service, and the example they set for future generations weighing whether to join the All-Volunteer Force.

Waiting for Trump to Revive Veteran Affairs. @FRoseDC. @MaryKissel

Washington, November 10 – As the 2016 election cycle moves into full swing, four experts from the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) have released a new report, ""Passing the Baton: A Bipartisan 2016 Agenda for the Veteran and Military Community.” The authors of the report – CNAS Military, Veterans, and Society Program Director Phillip Carter, CNAS Adjunct Fellow Jason Dempsey, CNAS Bacevich Fellow Katherine Kidder, and CNAS Research Assistant Amy Schafer – lay out a comprehensive overview of issues facing the veteran and military community and a plan with substantive recommendations for how the next President can best serve the veteran and military community.

Key recommendations of the report include:
• Continued focus by the next administration on immediate issues such as access to health care, transition to civilian employment, and support to veterans in crisis (like those facing homelessness or legal problems).
• Structural reform of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to better serve veterans, including better alignment of the VA’s resources and requirements.
• Expanded data sharing between the government, private, and non-profit sectors that enables needs assessment, resource allocation, and future planning.
• Elimination of barriers to public-private-nonprofit partnerships that could help veterans better succeed in civilian life.
• Identification of normative outcomes, and rigorous evaluation of how p ublic, private and nonprofit programs perform against these outcomes.
""The 2016 elections will mark a watershed moment for the veteran and military community,"" said Phillip Carter, CNAS Senior Fellow and one of the report's authors. ""This report outlines the critical issues and strategic issues facing this community as the nation ends two major wars, wrestles with an age of fiscal austerity, and enters a presidential election that will set the course of policy for this community and the nation.""

“Policies related to the care of our military, veterans and their families have far-reaching effects, not only on the government agencies providing care, but the entire private/public sector which must address any gaps in services,” said Anne Marie Dougherty, executive director of the Bob Woodruff Foundation which helped fund the report. “This report not only creates a dialogue as we look to elect our next Commander in Chief, it’s the first of its kind to comprehensively breakdown the demographics and issues facing today’s veterans.”

The link to the full report is available below:
http://www.cnas.org/passing-the-baton

Please find the Executive Summary of the report below:

On January 20, 2017, a new U.S. president will take the oath of office. At that moment, he or she will assume responsibility, as commander in chief of the armed forces, for the nation’s 2.4 million active and reserve service members and their 3 million family members. The next president will also inherit the task of supporting the nation’s 21 million veterans – a diverse population that has served presidents stretching back to Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

The next president, like those before, will have to grapple with a military that remains forward-deployed and engaged in myriad theaters against a broad array of threats. The needs of the active and reserve force, their families, and the veteran population continue, even as an age of fiscal austerity grips the federal government and affects the ability of federal agencies to serve the veteran and military community. At the same time, demographic, social, economic, and geographic change within the veteran and military community will continue, or even accelerate in some cases, changing the profile for this community.

This paper outlines a bipartisan agenda for the next administration to support the veteran and military community – to serve it as well as it has served the nation. Regardless of who takes office in January 2017, the issues facing this community will continue, and they will become the responsibility of the next president. The key findings and recommendations of this agenda include:
• Urgent and immediate issues. This set of issues includes those critical concerns facing the military and veteran community about which there is mostly political consensus, both on the problems and solutions. Transition, economic opportunity, health care access, and mental health provision, as well as support to veterans in crisis like those facing homelessness. No matter who wins in 2016, these issues will demand the next president’s attention and require immediate action (or effective continuance of current efforts) and signaling of dedicated oversight from the first day of the next administration.
• Operational issues. A combination of factors – from demographic change within the veteran community to pressure from federal budget fights – has exposed fissures, gaps, and tension points within the system that serves the veteran and military community. These include such issues as access to veterans’ health care reform and benefits support, reform of the military personnel system, and connection of the military to society. On these matters, some agreement exists as to the nature or scope of the problems, but there is sharp disagreement on how to address them. These issues deserve attention from the next president; however, the election will likely determine their priority and what answers the next administration favors.
• Strategic opportunities. Beyond the specific policy choices to be made by the next administration, there are a number of steps that can be taken by public-, private-, and nonprofit-sector leaders to continue momentum from the past 15 years of sup- port for the veteran and military community. These include opportunities to better share data inside and outside of government, use data to make better decisions affecting this community, and expand public-private-nonprofit partnerships to better serve the nation.
In addition to these points, this paper outlines a “first 100 days” agenda for the next president to immediately signal his/her commitment to the veteran and military community and take those necessary first steps to enable subsequent success. These steps include establishment of White House priorities and staff for this area, appointment and confirmation of key agency leaders, development of budget submissions to fully support this community, and early statements of administration policy on key issues such as funding priorities and the value of public-private partnerships.

Effective support for the veteran and military community matters for many reasons. National security depends on the United States’ ability to recruit, retain, manage, and support its service members and their families. Most veterans do well after service, but some struggle, often needing support to tackle health, economic, and wellness challenges that impede their transition to civilian life. The government has a sacred trust with its veterans to help with these challenges and support private- and nonprofit-sector efforts to help too. The nation benefits from the successful transition and future success of veterans in myriad ways, including the contributions these veterans make to society after service, and the example they set for future generations weighing whether to join the All-Volunteer Force.

"YEL 035 - HOW TO UNLOCK THE POWER OF YOUR BRAIN (JOHN ASSARAF)","Many entrepreneurs focus on how their business plays out in the market, but there’s another game that influences the final score: the one that rages in the mind. Win your inner game and you’re many steps closer to clinching success.
 That is how New York Times bestselling author and NeuroGym CEO John Assaraf depicts the mindset of the world’s most successful personalities, how he helps new generations of entrepreneurs develop a winning psychology, and how he recounts his own transition from a teenage gang member into a philanthropist and serial entrepreneur who have built multimillion dollar businesses and generated billions in revenues.  
 To go beyond his limiting environment and join the big leagues, John -- inspired by a mentor -- played the mind game. He unlearned everything he knew as a teenage crook and spent an hour everyday in the inner game, using his fears to fuel a hunger for success, purpose and meaning.
 The idea that positive psychology strongly influences success and happiness is nothing new. But in recent years, more and more studies confirm the link between the brain and our potential to achieve more than we have even thought possible. Neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to reorganize itself into new neural connections, enables us to consciously reprogram our instinctive behavior and develop positive, life-affirming habits.
 Join me as I interview John about his early years as an aimless teenager, the pivotal milestone that led him to become one of the world’s leading behavioral experts, and the new scientific techniques you can adopt to elevate your mindset.
 In this episode you’ll learn ...  How a teenage hoodlum selling drugs transformed into a successful behavioral coach with a heart for philanthropy. (1:56) The psychology and neural processes behind motivation, fear, success, and human potential. (10:12) How to subvert fear and use it to your advantage. (9:04) How to use the mental rehearsal technique to successfully hurdle business, strategic or personal obstacles. (14:39) The replicable steps needed to keep your personal best always levelling up on areas such as finance, health, career, and relationships. (19:10)  Quotes  ""If you're interested, you'll do what's convenient. If you're interested, you'll do what's easy. If you're interested, you'll do the simple stuff. But if you're committed, you'll do whatever it takes."" -- John Assaraf quoting his mentor, Alan Brown (4:40) ""All of my friends were hoodlums. I didn't have any normal friends ...I knew I had to really break free If I were really going to do something in my life."" -- John Assaraf (6:50) “My hunger came out of fear. My fear of being insignificant. My fear of being not smart enough. My fear of being not good enough.“ -- John Assaraf (8:37) ""Motivation is almost always followed by an unpleasant emotion such as fear."" -- John Assaraf (12:37) “Fear for a lot of people is something holding them back. I learned how to put fear behind me to push me forward.“ -- John Assaraf (9:04) “If you really take an hour a day and focus on the inner game, you can have anything you want in your life.” -- John Assaraf quoting his mentor, Alan Brown (5:25)   ""The reason you want to be aware of your [mental] patterns is to know which ones you want to accelerate and create into a habit vs. the ones you don't want to.""  -- John Assaraf (17:15) ""Here's the truth in business: the potential for failure always exists ... You can't get away from that. But the potential for success always exists as well.""  -- John Assaraf (17:24) ""Mitigating risks is focusing on [how to achieve] the positive outcome you want."" -- John Assaraf (18:56)  Ask yourself:
 How would you “re-calibrate the thermostat” in your business, professional, or personal life to surpass your achievements in the past year and set a new (and better) normal?

"Shields and Brooks on Trump’s ‘disdain’ for the intelligence community","
Watch Video | Listen to the Audio
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that brings us to the analysis of Shields and Brooks. That is syndicated columnist Mark Shields and New York Times columnist David Brooks.

Happy new year, gentlemen.

MARK SHIELDS: Happy new year, Judy.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Good seeing you in 2017.

So, let’s start by talking about this intelligence report.

Mark, the entire intelligence community is behind it. They’re saying without a shadow of a doubt, in so many words, they are confident the Russians tried to interfere in the U.S. election and they developed a clear preference for Donald Trump.

What are we to make of this? Does it change the way we look at this election?

MARK SHIELDS: I don’t know if it changes the way we look at it, Judy. It certainly changes the way we look at the United States’ relationship with Russia, I think, and in this sense, that the intelligence community said it made these findings with high confidence.

Ever since the weapons of mass destruction era and the decision on invading Iraq, the intelligence community has been very, very careful to avoid high confidence. That’s saying, we really believe this to be true. They have been more tentative.

There was no question. They were unequivocal and emphatic. Every American ought to be angry, ought to be concerned that an unfriendly nation, a nation that has cooperated with us certain places, but doesn’t wish us well, sought to sabotage American democracy, American confidence in our own democratic institutions, and to influence the outcome of the election.

That’s a cause of concern and worry and anger. And I would hope that we would respond, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans, to make sure it never happens again.

JUDY WOODRUFF: David, how should Americans look at this?

DAVID BROOKS: I agree with that, with anger, with shock.

We have sort of gotten used to the idea, because of the news leaks before this report. But the idea that Russia felt emboldened and apparently fearless to go into our election and manipulate our own election process, whether successfully or not, is a sign that they are outside the norms of normal society.

There’s always statecraft. There’s always disinformation. But this is a step up, a Russia that feels completely free to do this, a Putin who feels completely free to do this, without fear of penalty, and so far paying little penalty.

Partly, it’s motivated, I think, by animus toward Hillary Clinton, as we heard earlier in the program, things she said in 2011, 2012, partly, frankly, a desire, a belief that feeling Donald Trump will be tougher on ISIS.

But the thing that should most concern us is a shift in American foreign policy. We have had a bipartisan belief in American foreign policy based on the post-World War II institutions that believed in democratic global world, which Russia and the Soviet Union was often seen as hostile to. And most Republicans and Democrats have always basically believed in this world order.

Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and maybe Marine Le Pen do not agree with this basic structure of the world. They seem to have no respect for the institutions that were created after World War II, and they see a potential alliance of populists around the world who would fight Islam and restore a certain semblance of traditional values.

And so we could be seeing a pivot in American foreign policy that may be on the mind of Donald Trump, certainly seems to be on the mind of Steve Bannon, his ideologist. And this is a piece of that larger shift.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, Donald Trump, the president-elect, does have his own reaction to this report.

I mean, you know, joining in with what David’s saying, I mean, he started out by calling it a political witch-hunt. And then after he was briefed about it, he said — he made a very short comment and said, in so many words that, well, it didn’t affect the outcome of the election.

MARK SHIELDS: As usual, he takes the big picture. In other words, I won, and anything that in any way diminishes or tarnishes my personal victory, I reject.

His disparagement, make that disdain, openly, for the American intelligence community and its work is damaging to national security. I mean, the intelligence community, for the security of our nation, for the well-being of our nation, for the economic prosperity of our nation, competitiveness, depends on sources in other places.

And other nations depend upon our intelligence. And here we have the president-elect dismissing, disparaging, disdaining openly because it somehow, in his way — his perspective, diminishes his victory, is just astonishing.

JUDY WOODRUFF: David.

DAVID BROOKS: It’s happening on three levels, like, this story.

There is the big strategic level, which I described. Then there’s the Donald Trump ego level. And his ego is like a comet the size of Jupiter just traveling through the solar system, and we all have to be affected by its gravitational pull. So all of American foreign policy has to remind us that Donald Trump really did win this election all by himself, and nobody else could have helped, and so it was all me, me, me.

And that seems to be the center of his views. And then the third is, this is a guy who’s going to be taking over a public office, presidency of the United States. He is going to have a system built around him. He will have employees.

And he, as a public servant, will work with other public servants, presumably the intelligence community. But he seems completely uninterested in being part of this system which our founders set up. And so he seems to still be a lone wolf insulting his future employees.

And, believe me, woe to you who insults the intelligence community, if you’re president. You do not want to get on their bad side, because, A, they leak a lot. B, you actually need them to learn about the world. And he seems to be on purpose alienating the resources he’s going to have to draw upon.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as we just heard from John Kerry, Mark, the world is a more complicated place than it’s maybe ever been.

He talked about the number of different places that the U.S. now has to worry about its relationship with. And, right now, we’re at this critical point where we’re changing from one administration to the next. It’s always, I guess, a fraught time, but it just seems especially so this time.

MARK SHIELDS: Well, it does, and I think, in part, because of the reasons David announced, observed earlier, that the changing sort of organizing principle of postwar world and the United States. And we know, I think, probably more keenly and more acutely, the limits of our power.

If I could just add one thing to David’s observation earlier. And that is, Judy, I have lived through an awful lot of transitions from an election to inauguration. It is a period during which president-elects follow a pattern. They become more popular. What they do is, they submerge partisanship. They reach across the line. They do all sorts of symbolic things to unite the nation.

This president-elect has done just the opposite. He continued his rallies, apparently for self-gratification. He fired up his true believers. He continued to disparage and belittle his defeated opponent openly.

And toward what end? There’s been no symbolic reach. He’s had interviews, I guess, with Heidi Heitkamp, the Democratic senator from North Dakota. But there’s been no sense of any strategic sense of where the country is going or what it’s about.

Here he is tweeting about Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ratings on “The Apprentice?”

JUDY WOODRUFF: This morning.

MARK SHIELDS: He’s interfering? He’s making 12 calls into Ohio to defeat John Kasich’s Republican state chairman in the Republican state committee vote.

This is pettiness. And this is — this shows just no largeness of vision. And it’s really distressing.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, yesterday, David, in conjunction with this, he tweeted another criticism, I guess, of the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer. He called him the head clown in talking about the way the Democrats are handling Obama.

I did interview the vice president yesterday, who looked right into the camera and said, grow up, Donald.

You know, is that the kind of comment that’s likely to make a difference, do you think?

DAVID BROOKS: The vice president?

JUDY WOODRUFF: The vice president.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I’m sure Donald Trump is growing and maturing as we speak.

You know, I — we have gotten used to analyzing presidential statements in a certain way. Like, what is the policy implications? And we take them all very seriously, because, when a president speaks, as Mark said a couple of weeks ago, that usually means a lot.

But I have come to think we have to treat Donald Trump’s tweets like Snapchat. It’s just something that is going to go away. And it flies out of some region of his brain and it goes out into the ether. And usually it’s on the realm of media.

Even in his tweets of Russia, he was attacking CNN and NBC for their coverage. He’s a media commentator a lot of the time, even with Schwarzenegger. And so it will exist, and it will fill conversation for a moment. And then, like Snapchat, it will just go away.

And so I think, until he can give us something real, it’s sometimes best to just let them go with the wind.

JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when he calls Chuck Schumer the head clown, Mark, we just ignore it, or…

MARK SHIELDS: Judy, what does it help? How does it possibly help? He’s going to need Chuck Schumer.

Chuck Schumer is a proud and able and dedicated and skillful leader, and you don’t want him as an opponent. You don’t want him as a sworn adversary. And he’s a formidable figure legislatively. Why do it? It’s gratuitous.

On the Joe Biden interview, of all sad words of tongue and pen, these are the saddest that might have been. We went through an election where we had the two least-liked nominees in the modern history of American polling.

And you could not watch the interview — and I commend you for it last night — with Joe Biden without saying, I like this guy. I mean, he is a thoroughly likable man. And when he says, grow up, I mean, it wasn’t said — there was nothing mean about it. It was just — it was absolutely what a grownup would say.

This was a grownup talking. And the way I thought he talked about Democratic values was missing in the campaign of 2016, sorely to the Democrats’ disadvantage, it was just a — it was a marvelous — I commend it to anybody who missed it for any reason to watch it online.

JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the things I talked to the vice president about, David, was Obamacare and what the Republicans are going to do about it.

The administration is saying they’re afraid that they can’t make any changes unless they make bad changes to it. What do you see going on with it?

DAVID BROOKS: First, on the interview, I was struck by the way he kept emphasizing the Democrats did not campaign on the dignity of the working class.

MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

DAVID BROOKS: The policies of the Democratic Party have always been in cultural consonance with the culture of the working class. And, somehow, they missed that. And I thought he was very honest.

But also on the part of the interview — you saw a man who has been in governance, as he said, since he was 27. And when you’re in governance, you understand the limitations and the complexities of governance. It’s hard.

And on Obamacare, I’m not sure the Trump administration has thought in any complex way about how to repeal and replace. Repealing first and then replacing later doesn’t strike me — and a lot of the Republican health care experts I talk to — doesn’t strike them as just a workable thing to do.

You repeal some of the things, like maybe the — some of the premium supports that are in Obamacare, and then you replace it with something later, that seems likely in the short term to create exactly the sort of death spiral and destabilization that we’re all worried about.

And so it seems to me and it seems to a growing number of Republican senators, including Bob Corker and John McCain, that you have got to repeal and replace at the same time. You have to have a plan, or else you’re just creating a recipe for chaos.

And it’s not clear how much either the House leadership or the Trump administration has thought that through how exactly how it’s going to work.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Just 10 seconds, Mark. We will be watching.

MARK SHIELDS: What’s the big rush, Judy? What’s the big rush on the health care plan?

It’s been eight years. So they have had a lot of ideas. I mean, Paul Ryan said that. They have got ideas everywhere. They have no idea what they’re going to do. Repeal is low-hanging fruit. They have done it. They have done it 60 times. They will do it 60 more. They have no plan.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields, David Brooks, thank you both.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And that brings us to the analysis of Shields and Brooks. That is syndicated columnist Mark Shields and New York Times columnist David Brooks.

Happy new year, gentlemen.

MARK SHIELDS: Happy new year, Judy.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Good seeing you in 2017.

So, let’s start by talking about this intelligence report.

Mark, the entire intelligence community is behind it. They’re saying without a shadow of a doubt, in so many words, they are confident the Russians tried to interfere in the U.S. election and they developed a clear preference for Donald Trump.

What are we to make of this? Does it change the way we look at this election?

MARK SHIELDS: I don’t know if it changes the way we look at it, Judy. It certainly changes the way we look at the United States’ relationship with Russia, I think, and in this sense, that the intelligence community said it made these findings with high confidence.

Ever since the weapons of mass destruction era and the decision on invading Iraq, the intelligence community has been very, very careful to avoid high confidence. That’s saying, we really believe this to be true. They have been more tentative.

There was no question. They were unequivocal and emphatic. Every American ought to be angry, ought to be concerned that an unfriendly nation, a nation that has cooperated with us certain places, but doesn’t wish us well, sought to sabotage American democracy, American confidence in our own democratic institutions, and to influence the outcome of the election.

That’s a cause of concern and worry and anger. And I would hope that we would respond, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans, to make sure it never happens again.

JUDY WOODRUFF: David, how should Americans look at this?

DAVID BROOKS: I agree with that, with anger, with shock.

We have sort of gotten used to the idea, because of the news leaks before this report. But the idea that Russia felt emboldened and apparently fearless to go into our election and manipulate our own election process, whether successfully or not, is a sign that they are outside the norms of normal society.

There’s always statecraft. There’s always disinformation. But this is a step up, a Russia that feels completely free to do this, a Putin who feels completely free to do this, without fear of penalty, and so far paying little penalty.

Partly, it’s motivated, I think, by animus toward Hillary Clinton, as we heard earlier in the program, things she said in 2011, 2012, partly, frankly, a desire, a belief that feeling Donald Trump will be tougher on ISIS.

But the thing that should most concern us is a shift in American foreign policy. We have had a bipartisan belief in American foreign policy based on the post-World War II institutions that believed in democratic global world, which Russia and the Soviet Union was often seen as hostile to. And most Republicans and Democrats have always basically believed in this world order.

Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and maybe Marine Le Pen do not agree with this basic structure of the world. They seem to have no respect for the institutions that were created after World War II, and they see a potential alliance of populists around the world who would fight Islam and restore a certain semblance of traditional values.

And so we could be seeing a pivot in American foreign policy that may be on the mind of Donald Trump, certainly seems to be on the mind of Steve Bannon, his ideologist. And this is a piece of that larger shift.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, Donald Trump, the president-elect, does have his own reaction to this report.

I mean, you know, joining in with what David’s saying, I mean, he started out by calling it a political witch-hunt. And then after he was briefed about it, he said — he made a very short comment and said, in so many words that, well, it didn’t affect the outcome of the election.

MARK SHIELDS: As usual, he takes the big picture. In other words, I won, and anything that in any way diminishes or tarnishes my personal victory, I reject.

His disparagement, make that disdain, openly, for the American intelligence community and its work is damaging to national security. I mean, the intelligence community, for the security of our nation, for the well-being of our nation, for the economic prosperity of our nation, competitiveness, depends on sources in other places.

And other nations depend upon our intelligence. And here we have the president-elect dismissing, disparaging, disdaining openly because it somehow, in his way — his perspective, diminishes his victory, is just astonishing.

JUDY WOODRUFF: David.

DAVID BROOKS: It’s happening on three levels, like, this story.

There is the big strategic level, which I described. Then there’s the Donald Trump ego level. And his ego is like a comet the size of Jupiter just traveling through the solar system, and we all have to be affected by its gravitational pull. So all of American foreign policy has to remind us that Donald Trump really did win this election all by himself, and nobody else could have helped, and so it was all me, me, me.

And that seems to be the center of his views. And then the third is, this is a guy who’s going to be taking over a public office, presidency of the United States. He is going to have a system built around him. He will have employees.

And he, as a public servant, will work with other public servants, presumably the intelligence community. But he seems completely uninterested in being part of this system which our founders set up. And so he seems to still be a lone wolf insulting his future employees.

And, believe me, woe to you who insults the intelligence community, if you’re president. You do not want to get on their bad side, because, A, they leak a lot. B, you actually need them to learn about the world. And he seems to be on purpose alienating the resources he’s going to have to draw upon.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as we just heard from John Kerry, Mark, the world is a more complicated place than it’s maybe ever been.

He talked about the number of different places that the U.S. now has to worry about its relationship with. And, right now, we’re at this critical point where we’re changing from one administration to the next. It’s always, I guess, a fraught time, but it just seems especially so this time.

MARK SHIELDS: Well, it does, and I think, in part, because of the reasons David announced, observed earlier, that the changing sort of organizing principle of postwar world and the United States. And we know, I think, probably more keenly and more acutely, the limits of our power.

If I could just add one thing to David’s observation earlier. And that is, Judy, I have lived through an awful lot of transitions from an election to inauguration. It is a period during which president-elects follow a pattern. They become more popular. What they do is, they submerge partisanship. They reach across the line. They do all sorts of symbolic things to unite the nation.

This president-elect has done just the opposite. He continued his rallies, apparently for self-gratification. He fired up his true believers. He continued to disparage and belittle his defeated opponent openly.

And toward what end? There’s been no symbolic reach. He’s had interviews, I guess, with Heidi Heitkamp, the Democratic senator from North Dakota. But there’s been no sense of any strategic sense of where the country is going or what it’s about.

Here he is tweeting about Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ratings on “The Apprentice?”

JUDY WOODRUFF: This morning.

MARK SHIELDS: He’s interfering? He’s making 12 calls into Ohio to defeat John Kasich’s Republican state chairman in the Republican state committee vote.

This is pettiness. And this is — this shows just no largeness of vision. And it’s really distressing.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, yesterday, David, in conjunction with this, he tweeted another criticism, I guess, of the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer. He called him the head clown in talking about the way the Democrats are handling Obama.

I did interview the vice president yesterday, who looked right into the camera and said, grow up, Donald.

You know, is that the kind of comment that’s likely to make a difference, do you think?

DAVID BROOKS: The vice president?

JUDY WOODRUFF: The vice president.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I’m sure Donald Trump is growing and maturing as we speak.

You know, I — we have gotten used to analyzing presidential statements in a certain way. Like, what is the policy implications? And we take them all very seriously, because, when a president speaks, as Mark said a couple of weeks ago, that usually means a lot.

But I have come to think we have to treat Donald Trump’s tweets like Snapchat. It’s just something that is going to go away. And it flies out of some region of his brain and it goes out into the ether. And usually it’s on the realm of media.

Even in his tweets of Russia, he was attacking CNN and NBC for their coverage. He’s a media commentator a lot of the time, even with Schwarzenegger. And so it will exist, and it will fill conversation for a moment. And then, like Snapchat, it will just go away.

And so I think, until he can give us something real, it’s sometimes best to just let them go with the wind.

JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when he calls Chuck Schumer the head clown, Mark, we just ignore it, or…

MARK SHIELDS: Judy, what does it help? How does it possibly help? He’s going to need Chuck Schumer.

Chuck Schumer is a proud and able and dedicated and skillful leader, and you don’t want him as an opponent. You don’t want him as a sworn adversary. And he’s a formidable figure legislatively. Why do it? It’s gratuitous.

On the Joe Biden interview, of all sad words of tongue and pen, these are the saddest that might have been. We went through an election where we had the two least-liked nominees in the modern history of American polling.

And you could not watch the interview — and I commend you for it last night — with Joe Biden without saying, I like this guy. I mean, he is a thoroughly likable man. And when he says, grow up, I mean, it wasn’t said — there was nothing mean about it. It was just — it was absolutely what a grownup would say.

This was a grownup talking. And the way I thought he talked about Democratic values was missing in the campaign of 2016, sorely to the Democrats’ disadvantage, it was just a — it was a marvelous — I commend it to anybody who missed it for any reason to watch it online.

JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the things I talked to the vice president about, David, was Obamacare and what the Republicans are going to do about it.

The administration is saying they’re afraid that they can’t make any changes unless they make bad changes to it. What do you see going on with it?

DAVID BROOKS: First, on the interview, I was struck by the way he kept emphasizing the Democrats did not campaign on the dignity of the working class.

MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

DAVID BROOKS: The policies of the Democratic Party have always been in cultural consonance with the culture of the working class. And, somehow, they missed that. And I thought he was very honest.

But also on the part of the interview — you saw a man who has been in governance, as he said, since he was 27. And when you’re in governance, you understand the limitations and the complexities of governance. It’s hard.

And on Obamacare, I’m not sure the Trump administration has thought in any complex way about how to repeal and replace. Repealing first and then replacing later doesn’t strike me — and a lot of the Republican health care experts I talk to — doesn’t strike them as just a workable thing to do.

And so it seems to me and it seems to a growing number of Republican senators, including Bob Corker and John McCain, that you have got to repeal and replace at the same time. You have to have a plan, or else you’re just creating a recipe for chaos.

And it’s not clear how much either the House leadership or the Trump administration has thought that through how exactly how it’s going to work.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Just 10 seconds, Mark. We will be watching.

MARK SHIELDS: What’s the big rush, Judy? What’s the big rush on the health care plan?

It’s been eight years. So they have had a lot of ideas. I mean, Paul Ryan said that. They have got ideas everywhere. They have no idea what they’re going to do. Repeal is low-hanging fruit. They have done it. They have done it 60 times. They will do it 60 more. They have no plan.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields, David Brooks, thank you both.

He talked about the number of different places that the U.S. now has to worry about its relationship with. And, right now, we’re at this critical point where we’re changing from one administration to the next. It’s always, I guess, a fraught time, but it just seems especially so this time.

MARK SHIELDS: Well, it does, and I think, in part, because of the reasons David announced, observed earlier, that the changing sort of organizing principle of postwar world and the United States. And we know, I think, probably more keenly and more acutely, the limits of our power.

If I could just add one thing to David’s observation earlier. And that is, Judy, I have lived through an awful lot of transitions from an election to inauguration. It is a period during which president-elects follow a pattern. They become more popular. What they do is, they submerge partisanship. They reach across the line. They do all sorts of symbolic things to unite the nation.

This president-elect has done just the opposite. He continued his rallies, apparently for self-gratification. He fired up his true believers. He continued to disparage and belittle his defeated opponent openly.

And toward what end? There’s been no symbolic reach. He’s had interviews, I guess, with Heidi Heitkamp, the Democratic senator from North Dakota. But there’s been no sense of any strategic sense of where the country is going or what it’s about.

Here he is tweeting about Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ratings on “The Apprentice?”

JUDY WOODRUFF: This morning.

MARK SHIELDS: He’s interfering? He’s making 12 calls into Ohio to defeat John Kasich’s Republican state chairman in the Republican state committee vote.

This is pettiness. And this is — this shows just no largeness of vision. And it’s really distressing.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, yesterday, David, in conjunction with this, he tweeted another criticism, I guess, of the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer. He called him the head clown in talking about the way the Democrats are handling Obama.

I did interview the vice president yesterday, who looked right into the camera and said, grow up, Donald.

You know, is that the kind of comment that’s likely to make a difference, do you think?

DAVID BROOKS: The vice president?

JUDY WOODRUFF: The vice president.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I’m sure Donald Trump is growing and maturing as we speak.

You know, I — we have gotten used to analyzing presidential statements in a certain way. Like, what is the policy implications? And we take them all very seriously, because, when a president speaks, as Mark said a couple of weeks ago, that usually means a lot.

But I have come to think we have to treat Donald Trump’s tweets like Snapchat. It’s just something that is going to go away. And it flies out of some region of his brain and it goes out into the ether. And usually it’s on the realm of media.

Even in his tweets of Russia, he was attacking CNN and NBC for their coverage. He’s a media commentator a lot of the time, even with Schwarzenegger. And so it will exist, and it will fill conversation for a moment. And then, like Snapchat, it will just go away.

And so I think, until he can give us something real, it’s sometimes best to just let them go with the wind.

JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when he calls Chuck Schumer the head clown, Mark, we just ignore it, or…

MARK SHIELDS: Judy, what does it help? How does it possibly help? He’s going to need Chuck Schumer.

Chuck Schumer is a proud and able and dedicated and skillful leader, and you don’t want him as an opponent. You don’t want him as a sworn adversary. And he’s a formidable figure legislatively. Why do it? It’s gratuitous.

On the Joe Biden interview, of all sad words of tongue and pen, these are the saddest that might have been. We went through an election where we had the two least-liked nominees in the modern history of American polling.

And you could not watch the interview — and I commend you for it last night — with Joe Biden without saying, I like this guy. I mean, he is a thoroughly likable man. And when he says, grow up, I mean, it wasn’t said — there was nothing mean about it. It was just — it was absolutely what a grownup would say.

This was a grownup talking. And the way I thought he talked about Democratic values was missing in the campaign of 2016, sorely to the Democrats’ disadvantage, it was just a — it was a marvelous — I commend it to anybody who missed it for any reason to watch it online.

JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the things I talked to the vice president about, David, was Obamacare and what the Republicans are going to do about it.

The administration is saying they’re afraid that they can’t make any changes unless they make bad changes to it. What do you see going on with it?

DAVID BROOKS: First, on the interview, I was struck by the way he kept emphasizing the Democrats did not campaign on the dignity of the working class.

MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

DAVID BROOKS: The policies of the Democratic Party have always been in cultural consonance with the culture of the working class. And, somehow, they missed that. And I thought he was very honest.

But also on the part of the interview — you saw a man who has been in governance, as he said, since he was 27. And when you’re in governance, you understand the limitations and the complexities of governance. It’s hard.

And on Obamacare, I’m not sure the Trump administration has thought in any complex way about how to repeal and replace. Repealing first and then replacing later doesn’t strike me — and a lot of the Republican health care experts I talk to — doesn’t strike them as just a workable thing to do.

You repeal some of the things, like maybe the — some of the premium supports that are in Obamacare, and then you replace it with something later, that seems likely in the short term to create exactly the sort of death spiral and destabilization that we’re all worried about.

And so it seems to me and it seems to a growing number of Republican senators, including Bob Corker and John McCain, that you have got to repeal and replace at the same time. You have to have a plan, or else you’re just creating a recipe for chaos.

And it’s not clear how much either the House leadership or the Trump administration has thought that through how exactly how it’s going to work.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Just 10 seconds, Mark. We will be watching.

MARK SHIELDS: What’s the big rush, Judy? What’s the big rush on the health care plan?

It’s been eight years. So they have had a lot of ideas. I mean, Paul Ryan said that. They have got ideas everywhere. They have no idea what they’re going to do. Repeal is low-hanging fruit. They have done it. They have done it 60 times. They will do it 60 more. They have no plan.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And that brings us to the analysis of Shields and Brooks. That is syndicated columnist Mark Shields and New York Times columnist David Brooks.

Happy new year, gentlemen.

MARK SHIELDS: Happy new year, Judy.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Good seeing you in 2017.

So, let’s start by talking about this intelligence report.

Mark, the entire intelligence community is behind it. They’re saying without a shadow of a doubt, in so many words, they are confident the Russians tried to interfere in the U.S. election and they developed a clear preference for Donald Trump.

What are we to make of this? Does it change the way we look at this election?

MARK SHIELDS: I don’t know if it changes the way we look at it, Judy. It certainly changes the way we look at the United States’ relationship with Russia, I think, and in this sense, that the intelligence community said it made these findings with high confidence.

Ever since the weapons of mass destruction era and the decision on invading Iraq, the intelligence community has been very, very careful to avoid high confidence. That’s saying, we really believe this to be true. They have been more tentative.

There was no question. They were unequivocal and emphatic. Every American ought to be angry, ought to be concerned that an unfriendly nation, a nation that has cooperated with us certain places, but doesn’t wish us well, sought to sabotage American democracy, American confidence in our own democratic institutions, and to influence the outcome of the election.

That’s a cause of concern and worry and anger. And I would hope that we would respond, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans, to make sure it never happens again.

JUDY WOODRUFF: David, how should Americans look at this?

DAVID BROOKS: I agree with that, with anger, with shock.

We have sort of gotten used to the idea, because of the news leaks before this report. But the idea that Russia felt emboldened and apparently fearless to go into our election and manipulate our own election process, whether successfully or not, is a sign that they are outside the norms of normal society.

There’s always statecraft. There’s always disinformation. But this is a step up, a Russia that feels completely free to do this, a Putin who feels completely free to do this, without fear of penalty, and so far paying little penalty.

Partly, it’s motivated, I think, by animus toward Hillary Clinton, as we heard earlier in the program, things she said in 2011, 2012, partly, frankly, a desire, a belief that feeling Donald Trump will be tougher on ISIS.

But the thing that should most concern us is a shift in American foreign policy. We have had a bipartisan belief in American foreign policy based on the post-World War II institutions that believed in democratic global world, which Russia and the Soviet Union was often seen as hostile to. And most Republicans and Democrats have always basically believed in this world order.

Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and maybe Marine Le Pen do not agree with this basic structure of the world. They seem to have no respect for the institutions that were created after World War II, and they see a potential alliance of populists around the world who would fight Islam and restore a certain semblance of traditional values.

And so we could be seeing a pivot in American foreign policy that may be on the mind of Donald Trump, certainly seems to be on the mind of Steve Bannon, his ideologist. And this is a piece of that larger shift.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, Donald Trump, the president-elect, does have his own reaction to this report.

I mean, you know, joining in with what David’s saying, I mean, he started out by calling it a political witch-hunt. And then after he was briefed about it, he said — he made a very short comment and said, in so many words that, well, it didn’t affect the outcome of the election.

MARK SHIELDS: As usual, he takes the big picture. In other words, I won, and anything that in any way diminishes or tarnishes my personal victory, I reject.

His disparagement, make that disdain, openly, for the American intelligence community and its work is damaging to national security. I mean, the intelligence community, for the security of our nation, for the well-being of our nation, for the economic prosperity of our nation, competitiveness, depends on sources in other places.

And other nations depend upon our intelligence. And here we have the president-elect dismissing, disparaging, disdaining openly because it somehow, in his way — his perspective, diminishes his victory, is just astonishing.

JUDY WOODRUFF: David.

DAVID BROOKS: It’s happening on three levels, like, this story.

There is the big strategic level, which I described. Then there’s the Donald Trump ego level. And his ego is like a comet the size of Jupiter just traveling through the solar system, and we all have to be affected by its gravitational pull. So all of American foreign policy has to remind us that Donald Trump really did win this election all by himself, and nobody else could have helped, and so it was all me, me, me.

And that seems to be the center of his views. And then the third is, this is a guy who’s going to be taking over a public office, presidency of the United States. He is going to have a system built around him. He will have employees.

And he, as a public servant, will work with other public servants, presumably the intelligence community. But he seems completely uninterested in being part of this system which our founders set up. And so he seems to still be a lone wolf insulting his future employees.

And, believe me, woe to you who insults the intelligence community, if you’re president. You do not want to get on their bad side, because, A, they leak a lot. B, you actually need them to learn about the world. And he seems to be on purpose alienating the resources he’s going to have to draw upon.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as we just heard from John Kerry, Mark, the world is a more complicated place than it’s maybe ever been.

He talked about the number of different places that the U.S. now has to worry about its relationship with. And, right now, we’re at this critical point where we’re changing from one administration to the next. It’s always, I guess, a fraught time, but it just seems especially so this time.

MARK SHIELDS: Well, it does, and I think, in part, because of the reasons David announced, observed earlier, that the changing sort of organizing principle of postwar world and the United States. And we know, I think, probably more keenly and more acutely, the limits of our power.

If I could just add one thing to David’s observation earlier. And that is, Judy, I have lived through an awful lot of transitions from an election to inauguration. It is a period during which president-elects follow a pattern. They become more popular. What they do is, they submerge partisanship. They reach across the line.

And so I think, until he can give us something real, it’s sometimes best to just let them go with the wind.

JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when he calls Chuck Schumer the head clown, Mark, we just ignore it, or…

MARK SHIELDS: Judy, what does it help? How does it possibly help? He’s going to need Chuck Schumer.

Chuck Schumer is a proud and able and dedicated and skillful leader, and you don’t want him as an opponent. You don’t want him as a sworn adversary. And he’s a formidable figure legislatively. Why do it? It’s gratuitous.

Mark, the entire intelligence community is behind it. They’re saying without a shadow of a doubt, in so many words, they are confident the Russians tried to interfere in the U.S. election and they developed a clear preference for Donald Trump.

What are we to make of this? Does it change the way we look at this election?

MARK SHIELDS: I don’t know if it changes the way we look at it, Judy. It certainly changes the way we look at the United States’ relationship with Russia, I think, and in this sense, that the intelligence community said it made these findings with high confidence.

Ever since the weapons of mass destruction era and the decision on invading Iraq, the intelligence community has been very, very careful to avoid high confidence. That’s saying, we really believe this to be true. They have been more tentative.

There was no question. They were unequivocal and emphatic. Every American ought to be angry, ought to be concerned that an unfriendly nation, a nation that has cooperated with us certain places, but doesn’t wish us well, sought to sabotage American democracy, American confidence in our own democratic institutions, and to influence the outcome of the election.

That’s a cause of concern and worry and anger. And I would hope that we would respond, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans, to make sure it never happens again.

JUDY WOODRUFF: David, how should Americans look at this?

DAVID BROOKS: I agree with that, with anger, with shock.

We have sort of gotten used to the idea, because of the news leaks before this report. But the idea that Russia felt emboldened and apparently fearless to go into our election and manipulate our own election process, whether successfully or not, is a sign that they are outside the norms of normal society.

There’s always statecraft. There’s always disinformation. But this is a step up, a Russia that feels completely free to do this, a Putin who feels completely free to do this, without fear of penalty, and so far paying little penalty.

Partly, it’s motivated, I think, by animus toward Hillary Clinton, as we heard earlier in the program, things she said in 2011, 2012, partly, frankly, a desire, a belief that feeling Donald Trump will be tougher on ISIS.

But the thing that should most concern us is a shift in American foreign policy. We have had a bipartisan belief in American foreign policy based on the post-World War II institutions that believed in democratic global world, which Russia and the Soviet Union was often seen as hostile to. And most Republicans and Democrats have always basically believed in this world order.

Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and maybe Marine Le Pen do not agree with this basic structure of the world. They seem to have no respect for the institutions that were created after World War II, and they see a potential alliance of populists around the world who would fight Islam and restore a certain semblance of traditional values.

And so we could be seeing a pivot in American foreign policy that may be on the mind of Donald Trump, certainly seems to be on the mind of Steve Bannon, his ideologist. And this is a piece of that larger shift.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, Donald Trump, the president-elect, does have his own reaction to this report.

I mean, you know, joining in with what David’s saying, I mean, he started out by calling it a political witch-hunt. And then after he was briefed about it, he said — he made a very short comment and said, in so many words that, well, it didn’t affect the outcome of the election.

MARK SHIELDS: As usual, he takes the big picture. In other words, I won, and anything that in any way diminishes or tarnishes my personal victory, I reject.

His disparagement, make that disdain, openly, for the American intelligence community and its work is damaging to national security. I mean, the intelligence community, for the security of our nation, for the well-being of our nation, for the economic prosperity of our nation, competitiveness, depends on sources in other places.

And other nations depend upon our intelligence. And here we have the president-elect dismissing, disparaging, disdaining openly because it somehow, in his way — his perspective, diminishes his victory, is just astonishing.

JUDY WOODRUFF: David.

DAVID BROOKS: It’s happening on three levels, like, this story.

There is the big strategic level, which I described. Then there’s the Donald Trump ego level. And his ego is like a comet the size of Jupiter just traveling through the solar system, and we all have to be affected by its gravitational pull. So all of American foreign policy has to remind us that Donald Trump really did win this election all by himself, and nobody else could have helped, and so it was all me, me, me.

And that seems to be the center of his views. And then the third is, this is a guy who’s going to be taking over a public office, presidency of the United States. He is going to have a system built around him. He will have employees.

And he, as a public servant, will work with other public servants, presumably the intelligence community. But he seems completely uninterested in being part of this system which our founders set up. And so he seems to still be a lone wolf insulting his future employees.

And, believe me, woe to you who insults the intelligence community, if you’re president. You do not want to get on their bad side, because, A, they leak a lot. B, you actually need them to learn about the world. And he seems to be on purpose alienating the resources he’s going to have to draw upon.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as we just heard from John Kerry, Mark, the world is a more complicated place than it’s maybe ever been.

He talked about the number of different places that the U.S. now has to worry about its relationship with. And, right now, we’re at this critical point where we’re changing from one administration to the next. It’s always, I guess, a fraught time, but it just seems especially so this time.

MARK SHIELDS: Well, it does, and I think, in part, because of the reasons David announced, observed earlier, that the changing sort of organizing principle of postwar world and the United States. And we know, I think, probably more keenly and more acutely, the limits of our power.

If I could just add one thing to David’s observation earlier. And that is, Judy, I have lived through an awful lot of transitions from an election to inauguration. It is a period during which president-elects follow a pattern. They become more popular. What they do is, they submerge partisanship. They reach across the line. They do all sorts of symbolic things to unite the nation.

This president-elect has done just the opposite. He continued his rallies, apparently for self-gratification. He fired up his true believers. He continued to disparage and belittle his defeated opponent openly.

And toward what end? There’s been no symbolic reach. He’s had interviews, I guess, with Heidi Heitkamp, the Democratic senator from North Dakota. But there’s been no sense of any strategic sense of where the country is going or what it’s about.

Here he is tweeting about Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ratings on “The Apprentice?”

JUDY WOODRUFF: This morning.

MARK SHIELDS: He’s interfering? He’s making 12 calls into Ohio to defeat John Kasich’s Republican state chairman in the Republican state committee vote.

This is pettiness. And this is — this shows just no largeness of vision. And it’s really distressing.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, yesterday, David, in conjunction with this, he tweeted another criticism, I guess, of the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer. He called him the head clown in talking about the way the Democrats are handling Obama.

I did interview the vice president yesterday, who looked right into the camera and said, grow up, Donald.

You know, is that the kind of comment that’s likely to make a difference, do you think?

DAVID BROOKS: The vice president?

JUDY WOODRUFF: The vice president.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I’m sure Donald Trump is growing and maturing as we speak.

You know, I — we have gotten used to analyzing presidential statements in a certain way. Like, what is the policy implications? And we take them all very seriously, because, when a president speaks, as Mark said a couple of weeks ago, that usually means a lot.

But I have come to think we have to treat Donald Trump’s tweets like Snapchat. It’s just something that is going to go away. And it flies out of some region of his brain and it goes out into the ether. And usually it’s on the realm of media.

Even in his tweets of Russia, he was attacking CNN and NBC for their coverage. He’s a media commentator a lot of the time, even with Schwarzenegger. And so it will exist, and it will fill conversation for a moment. And then, like Snapchat, it will just go away.

And so I think, until he can give us something real, it’s sometimes best to just let them go with the wind.

JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when he calls Chuck Schumer the head clown, Mark, we just ignore it, or…

MARK SHIELDS: Judy, what does it help? How does it possibly help? He’s going to need Chuck Schumer.

Chuck Schumer is a proud and able and dedicated and skillful leader, and you don’t want him as an opponent. You don’t want him as a sworn adversary. And he’s a formidable figure legislatively. Why do it? It’s gratuitous.

On the Joe Biden interview, of all sad words of tongue and pen, these are the saddest that might have been. We went through an election where we had the two least-liked nominees in the modern history of American polling.

And you could not watch the interview — and I commend you for it last night — with Joe Biden without saying, I like this guy. I mean, he is a thoroughly likable man. And when he says, grow up, I mean, it wasn’t said — there was nothing mean about it. It was just — it was absolutely what a grownup would say.

This was a grownup talking. And the way I thought he talked about Democratic values was missing in the campaign of 2016, sorely to the Democrats’ disadvantage, it was just a — it was a marvelous — I commend it to anybody who missed it for any reason to watch it online.

JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the things I talked to the vice president about, David, was Obamacare and what the Republicans are going to do about it.

The administration is saying they’re afraid that they can’t make any changes unless they make bad changes to it. What do you see going on with it?

DAVID BROOKS: First, on the interview, I was struck by the way he kept emphasizing the Democrats did not campaign on the dignity of the working class.

MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

DAVID BROOKS: The policies of the Democratic Party have always been in cultural consonance with the culture of the working class. And, somehow, they missed that. And I thought he was very honest.

But also on the part of the interview — you saw a man who has been in governance, as he said, since he was 27. And when you’re in governance, you understand the limitations and the complexities of governance. It’s hard.

And on Obamacare, I’m not sure the Trump administration has thought in any complex way about how to repeal and replace. Repealing first and then replacing later doesn’t strike me — and a lot of the Republican health care experts I talk to — doesn’t strike them as just a workable thing to do.

You repeal some of the things, like maybe the — some of the premium supports that are in Obamacare, and then you replace it with something later, that seems likely in the short term to create exactly the sort of death spiral and destabilization that we’re all worried about.

And so it seems to me and it seems to a growing number of Republican senators, including Bob Corker and John McCain, that you have got to repeal and replace at the same time. You have to have a plan, or else you’re just creating a recipe for chaos.

And it’s not clear how much either the House leadership or the Trump administration has thought that through how exactly how it’s going to work.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Just 10 seconds, Mark. We will be watching.

MARK SHIELDS: What’s the big rush, Judy? What’s the big rush on the health care plan?

It’s been eight years. So they have had a lot of ideas. I mean, Paul Ryan said that. They have got ideas everywhere. They have no idea what they’re going to do. Repeal is low-hanging fruit. They have done it. They have done it 60 times. They will do it 60 more. They have no plan.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields, David Brooks, thank you both.

You know, I — we have gotten used to analyzing presidential statements in a certain way. Like, what is the policy implications? And we take them all very seriously, because, when a president speaks, as Mark said a couple of weeks ago, that usually means a lot.

But I have come to think we have to treat Donald Trump’s tweets like Snapchat. It’s just something that is going to go away. And it flies out of some region of his brain and it goes out into the ether. And usually it’s on the realm of media.

Even in his tweets of Russia, he was attacking CNN and NBC for their coverage. He’s a media commentator a lot of the time, even with Schwarzenegger. And so it will exist, and it will fill conversation for a moment. And then, like Snapchat, it will just go away.

And so I think, until he can give us something real, it’s sometimes best to just let them go with the wind.

JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when he calls Chuck Schumer the head clown, Mark, we just ignore it, or…

MARK SHIELDS: Judy, what does it help? How does it possibly help? He’s going to need Chuck Schumer.

Chuck Schumer is a proud and able and dedicated and skillful leader, and you don’t want him as an opponent. You don’t want him as a sworn adversary. And he’s a formidable figure legislatively. Why do it? It’s gratuitous.

On the Joe Biden interview, of all sad words of tongue and pen, these are the saddest that might have been. We went through an election where we had the two least-liked nominees in the modern history of American polling.

And you could not watch the interview — and I commend you for it last night — with Joe Biden without saying, I like this guy. I mean, he is a thoroughly likable man. And when he says, grow up, I mean, it wasn’t said — there was nothing mean about it. It was just — it was absolutely what a grownup would say.

This was a grownup talking. And the way I thought he talked about Democratic values was missing in the campaign of 2016, sorely to the Democrats’ disadvantage, it was just a — it was a marvelous — I commend it to anybody who missed it for any reason to watch it online.

JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the things I talked to the vice president about, David, was Obamacare and what the Republicans are going to do about it.

The administration is saying they’re afraid that they can’t make any changes unless they make bad changes to it. What do you see going on with it?

DAVID BROOKS: First, on the interview, I was struck by the way he kept emphasizing the Democrats did not campaign on the dignity of the working class.

MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

DAVID BROOKS: The policies of the Democratic Party have always been in cultural consonance with the culture of the working class. And, somehow, they missed that. And I thought he was very honest.

But also on the part of the interview — you saw a man who has been in governance, as he said, since he was 27. And when you’re in governance, you understand the limitations and the complexities of governance. It’s hard.

And on Obamacare, I’m not sure the Trump administration has thought in any complex way about how to repeal and replace. Repealing first and then replacing later doesn’t strike me — and a lot of the Republican health care experts I talk to — doesn’t strike them as just a workable thing to do.

You repeal some of the things, like maybe the — some of the premium supports that are in Obamacare, and then you replace it with something later, that seems likely in the short term to create exactly the sort of death spiral and destabilization that we’re all worried about.

And so it seems to me and it seems to a growing number of Republican senators, including Bob Corker and John McCain, that you have got to repeal and replace at the same time. You have to have a plan, or else you’re just creating a recipe for chaos.

And it’s not clear how much either the House leadership or the Trump administration has thought that through how exactly how it’s going to work.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Just 10 seconds, Mark. We will be watching.

MARK SHIELDS: What’s the big rush, Judy? What’s the big rush on the health care plan?

It’s been eight years. So they have had a lot of ideas. I mean, Paul Ryan said that. They have got ideas everywhere. They have no idea what they’re going to do. Repeal is low-hanging fruit. They have done it. They have done it 60 times. They will do it 60 more. They have no plan.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And that brings us to the analysis of Shields and Brooks. That is syndicated columnist Mark Shields and New York Times columnist David Brooks.

Happy new year, gentlemen.

MARK SHIELDS: Happy new year, Judy.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Good seeing you in 2017.

So, let’s start by talking about this intelligence report.

Mark, the entire intelligence community is behind it. They’re saying without a shadow of a doubt, in so many words, they are confident the Russians tried to interfere in the U.S. election and they developed a clear preference for Donald Trump.

What are we to make of this? Does it change the way we look at this election?

MARK SHIELDS: I don’t know if it changes the way we look at it, Judy. It certainly changes the way we look at the United States’ relationship with Russia, I think, and in this sense, that the intelligence community said it made these findings with high confidence.

Ever since the weapons of mass destruction era and the decision on invading Iraq, the intelligence community has been very, very careful to avoid high confidence. That’s saying, we really believe this to be true. They have been more tentative.

There was no question. They were unequivocal and emphatic. Every American ought to be angry, ought to be concerned that an unfriendly nation, a nation that has cooperated with us certain places, but doesn’t wish us well, sought to sabotage American democracy, American confidence in our own democratic institutions, and to influence the outcome of the election.

That’s a cause of concern and worry and anger. And I would hope that we would respond, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans, to make sure it never happens again.

JUDY WOODRUFF: David, how should Americans look at this?

DAVID BROOKS: I agree with that, with anger, with shock.

We have sort of gotten used to the idea, because of the news leaks before this report. But the idea that Russia felt emboldened and apparently fearless to go into our election and manipulate our own election process, whether successfully or not, is a sign that they are outside the norms of normal society.

There’s always statecraft. There’s always disinformation. But this is a step up, a Russia that feels completely free to do this, a Putin who feels completely free to do this, without fear of penalty, and so far paying little penalty.

Partly, it’s motivated, I think, by animus toward Hillary Clinton, as we heard earlier in the program, things she said in 2011, 2012, partly, frankly, a desire, a belief that feeling Donald Trump will be tougher on ISIS.

But the thing that should most concern us is a shift in American foreign policy. We have had a bipartisan belief in American foreign policy based on the post-World War II institutions that believed in democratic global world, which Russia and the Soviet Union was often seen as hostile to. And most Republicans and Democrats have always basically believed in this world order.

Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and maybe Marine Le Pen do not agree with this basic structure of the world. They seem to have no respect for the institutions that were created after World War II, and they see a potential alliance of populists around the world who would fight Islam and restore a certain semblance of traditional values.

And so we could be seeing a pivot in American foreign policy that may be on the mind of Donald Trump, certainly seems to be on the mind of Steve Bannon, his ideologist. And this is a piece of that larger shift.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, Donald Trump, the president-elect, does have his own reaction to this report.

I mean, you know, joining in with what David’s saying, I mean, he started out by calling it a political witch-hunt. And then after he was briefed about it, he said — he made a very short comment and said, in so many words that, well, it didn’t affect the outcome of the election.

MARK SHIELDS: As usual, he takes the big picture. In other words, I won, and anything that in any way diminishes or tarnishes my personal victory, I reject.

His disparagement, make that disdain, openly, for the American intelligence community and its work is damaging to national security. I mean, the intelligence community, for the security of our nation, for the well-being of our nation, for the economic prosperity of our nation, competitiveness, depends on sources in other places.

And other nations depend upon our intelligence. And here we have the president-elect dismissing, disparaging, disdaining openly because it somehow, in his way — his perspective, diminishes his victory, is just astonishing.

JUDY WOODRUFF: David.

DAVID BROOKS: It’s happening on three levels, like, this story.

There is the big strategic level, which I described. Then there’s the Donald Trump ego level. And his ego is like a comet the size of Jupiter just traveling through the solar system, and we all have to be affected by its gravitational pull. So all of American foreign policy has to remind us that Donald Trump really did win this election all by himself, and nobody else could have helped, and so it was all me, me, me.

And that seems to be the center of his views. And then the third is, this is a guy who’s going to be taking over a public office, presidency of the United States. He is going to have a system built around him. He will have employees.

And he, as a public servant, will work with other public servants, presumably the intelligence community. But he seems completely uninterested in being part of this system which our founders set up. And so he seems to still be a lone wolf insulting his future employees.

And, believe me, woe to you who insults the intelligence community, if you’re president. You do not want to get on their bad side, because, A, they leak a lot. B, you actually need them to learn about the world. And he seems to be on purpose alienating the resources he’s going to have to draw upon.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as we just heard from John Kerry, Mark, the world is a more complicated place than it’s maybe ever been.

He talked about the number of different places that the U.S. now has to worry about its relationship with. And, right now, we’re at this critical point where we’re changing from one administration to the next. It’s always, I guess, a fraught time, but it just seems especially so this time.

MARK SHIELDS: Well, it does, and I think, in part, because of the reasons David announced, observed earlier, that the changing sort of organizing principle of postwar world and the United States. And we know, I think, probably more keenly and more acutely, the limits of our power.

If I could just add one thing to David’s observation earlier. And that is, Judy, I have lived through an awful lot of transitions from an election to inauguration. It is a period during which president-elects follow a pattern. They become more popular. What they do is, they submerge partisanship. They reach across the line. They do all sorts of symbolic things to unite the nation.

This president-elect has done just the opposite. He continued his rallies, apparently for self-gratification. He fired up his true believers. He continued to disparage and belittle his defeated opponent openly.

And toward what end? There’s been no symbolic reach. He’s had interviews, I guess, with Heidi Heitkamp, the Democratic senator from North Dakota. But there’s been no sense of any strategic sense of where the country is going or what it’s about.

Here he is tweeting about Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ratings on “The Apprentice?”

JUDY WOODRUFF: This morning.

MARK SHIELDS: He’s interfering? He’s making 12 calls into Ohio to defeat John Kasich’s Republican state chairman in the Republican state committee vote.

This is pettiness. And this is — this shows just no largeness of vision. And it’s really distressing.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, yesterday, David, in conjunction with this, he tweeted another criticism, I guess, of the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer. He called him the head clown in talking about the way the Democrats are handling Obama.

I did interview the vice president yesterday, who looked right into the camera and said, grow up, Donald.

You know, is that the kind of comment that’s likely to make a difference, do you think?

DAVID BROOKS: The vice president?

JUDY WOODRUFF: The vice president.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I’m sure Donald Trump is growing and maturing as we speak.

You know, I — we have gotten used to analyzing presidential statements in a certain way. Like, what is the policy implications? And we take them all very seriously, because, when a president speaks, as Mark said a couple of weeks ago, that usually means a lot.

But I have come to think we have to treat Donald Trump’s tweets like Snapchat. It’s just something that is going to go away. And it flies out of some region of his brain and it goes out into the ether. And usually it’s on the realm of media.

Even in his tweets of Russia, he was attacking CNN and NBC for their coverage. He’s a media commentator a lot of the time, even with Schwarzenegger. And so it will exist, and it will fill conversation for a moment. And then, like Snapchat, it will just go away.

And so I think, until he can give us something real, it’s sometimes best to just let them go with the wind.

JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when he calls Chuck Schumer the head clown, Mark, we just ignore it, or…

MARK SHIELDS: Judy, what does it help? How does it possibly help? He’s going to need Chuck Schumer.

Chuck Schumer is a proud and able and dedicated and skillful leader, and you don’t want him as an opponent. You don’t want him as a sworn adversary. And he’s a formidable figure legislatively. Why do it? It’s gratuitous.

On the Joe Biden interview, of all sad words of tongue and pen, these are the saddest that might have been. We went through an election where we had the two least-liked nominees in the modern history of American polling.

DAVID BROOKS: The policies of the Democratic Party have always been in cultural consonance with the culture of the working class. And, somehow, they missed that. And I thought he was very honest.

But also on the part of the interview — you saw a man who has been in governance, as he said, since he was 27. And when you’re in governance, you understand the limitations and the complexities of governance. It’s hard.

And so we could be seeing a pivot in American foreign policy that may be on the mind of Donald Trump, certainly seems to be on the mind of Steve Bannon, his ideologist. And this is a piece of that larger shift.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, Donald Trump, the president-elect, does have his own reaction to this report.

I mean, you know, joining in with what David’s saying, I mean, he started out by calling it a political witch-hunt. And then after he was briefed about it, he said — he made a very short comment and said, in so many words that, well, it didn’t affect the outcome of the election.

MARK SHIELDS: As usual, he takes the big picture. In other words, I won, and anything that in any way diminishes or tarnishes my personal victory, I reject.

His disparagement, make that disdain, openly, for the American intelligence community and its work is damaging to national security. I mean, the intelligence community, for the security of our nation, for the well-being of our nation, for the economic prosperity of our nation, competitiveness, depends on sources in other places.

And other nations depend upon our intelligence. And here we have the president-elect dismissing, disparaging, disdaining openly because it somehow, in his way — his perspective, diminishes his victory, is just astonishing.

JUDY WOODRUFF: David.

DAVID BROOKS: It’s happening on three levels, like, this story.

There is the big strategic level, which I described. Then there’s the Donald Trump ego level. And his ego is like a comet the size of Jupiter just traveling through the solar system, and we all have to be affected by its gravitational pull. So all of American foreign policy has to remind us that Donald Trump really did win this election all by himself, and nobody else could have helped, and so it was all me, me, me.

And that seems to be the center of his views. And then the third is, this is a guy who’s going to be taking over a public office, presidency of the United States. He is going to have a system built around him. He will have employees.

And he, as a public servant, will work with other public servants, presumably the intelligence community. But he seems completely uninterested in being part of this system which our founders set up. And so he seems to still be a lone wolf insulting his future employees.

And, believe me, woe to you who insults the intelligence community, if you’re president. You do not want to get on their bad side, because, A, they leak a lot. B, you actually need them to learn about the world. And he seems to be on purpose alienating the resources he’s going to have to draw upon.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as we just heard from John Kerry, Mark, the world is a more complicated place than it’s maybe ever been.

He talked about the number of different places that the U.S. now has to worry about its relationship with. And, right now, we’re at this critical point where we’re changing from one administration to the next. It’s always, I guess, a fraught time, but it just seems especially so this time.

MARK SHIELDS: Well, it does, and I think, in part, because of the reasons David announced, observed earlier, that the changing sort of organizing principle of postwar world and the United States. And we know, I think, probably more keenly and more acutely, the limits of our power.

If I could just add one thing to David’s observation earlier. And that is, Judy, I have lived through an awful lot of transitions from an election to inauguration. It is a period during which president-elects follow a pattern. They become more popular. What they do is, they submerge partisanship. They reach across the line. They do all sorts of symbolic things to unite the nation.

This president-elect has done just the opposite. He continued his rallies, apparently for self-gratification. He fired up his true believers. He continued to disparage and belittle his defeated opponent openly.

And toward what end? There’s been no symbolic reach. He’s had interviews, I guess, with Heidi Heitkamp, the Democratic senator from North Dakota. But there’s been no sense of any strategic sense of where the country is going or what it’s about.

Here he is tweeting about Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ratings on “The Apprentice?”

JUDY WOODRUFF: This morning.

MARK SHIELDS: He’s interfering? He’s making 12 calls into Ohio to defeat John Kasich’s Republican state chairman in the Republican state committee vote.

This is pettiness. And this is — this shows just no largeness of vision. And it’s really distressing.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, yesterday, David, in conjunction with this, he tweeted another criticism, I guess, of the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer. He called him the head clown in talking about the way the Democrats are handling Obama.

I did interview the vice president yesterday, who looked right into the camera and said, grow up, Donald.

You know, is that the kind of comment that’s likely to make a difference, do you think?

DAVID BROOKS: The vice president?

JUDY WOODRUFF: The vice president.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I’m sure Donald Trump is growing and maturing as we speak.

You know, I — we have gotten used to analyzing presidential statements in a certain way. Like, what is the policy implications? And we take them all very seriously, because, when a president speaks, as Mark said a couple of weeks ago, that usually means a lot.

But I have come to think we have to treat Donald Trump’s tweets like Snapchat. It’s just something that is going to go away. And it flies out of some region of his brain and it goes out into the ether. And usually it’s on the realm of media.

Even in his tweets of Russia, he was attacking CNN and NBC for their coverage. He’s a media commentator a lot of the time, even with Schwarzenegger. And so it will exist, and it will fill conversation for a moment. And then, like Snapchat, it will just go away.

And so I think, until he can give us something real, it’s sometimes best to just let them go with the wind.

JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when he calls Chuck Schumer the head clown, Mark, we just ignore it, or…

MARK SHIELDS: Judy, what does it help? How does it possibly help? He’s going to need Chuck Schumer.

Chuck Schumer is a proud and able and dedicated and skillful leader, and you don’t want him as an opponent. You don’t want him as a sworn adversary. And he’s a formidable figure legislatively. Why do it? It’s gratuitous.

On the Joe Biden interview, of all sad words of tongue and pen, these are the saddest that might have been. We went through an election where we had the two least-liked nominees in the modern history of American polling.

And you could not watch the interview — and I commend you for it last night — with Joe Biden without saying, I like this guy. I mean, he is a thoroughly likable man. And when he says, grow up, I mean, it wasn’t said — there was nothing mean about it. It was just — it was absolutely what a grownup would say.

This was a grownup talking. And the way I thought he talked about Democratic values was missing in the campaign of 2016, sorely to the Democrats’ disadvantage, it was just a — it was a marvelous — I commend it to anybody who missed it for any reason to watch it online.

JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the things I talked to the vice president about, David, was Obamacare and what the Republicans are going to do about it.

The administration is saying they’re afraid that they can’t make any changes unless they make bad changes to it. What do you see going on with it?

DAVID BROOKS: First, on the interview, I was struck by the way he kept emphasizing the Democrats did not campaign on the dignity of the working class.

MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

DAVID BROOKS: The policies of the Democratic Party have always been in cultural consonance with the culture of the working class. And, somehow, they missed that. And I thought he was very honest.

But also on the part of the interview — you saw a man who has been in governance, as he said, since he was 27. And when you’re in governance, you understand the limitations and the complexities of governance. It’s hard.

And on Obamacare, I’m not sure the Trump administration has thought in any complex way about how to repeal and replace. Repealing first and then replacing later doesn’t strike me — and a lot of the Republican health care experts I talk to — doesn’t strike them as just a workable thing to do.

You repeal some of the things, like maybe the — some of the premium supports that are in Obamacare, and then you replace it with something later, that seems likely in the short term to create exactly the sort of death spiral and destabilization that we’re all worried about.

And so it seems to me and it seems to a growing number of Republican senators, including Bob Corker and John McCain, that you have got to repeal and replace at the same time. You have to have a plan, or else you’re just creating a recipe for chaos.

And it’s not clear how much either the House leadership or the Trump administration has thought that through how exactly how it’s going to work.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Just 10 seconds, Mark. We will be watching.

MARK SHIELDS: What’s the big rush, Judy? What’s the big rush on the health care plan?

It’s been eight years. So they have had a lot of ideas. I mean, Paul Ryan said that. They have got ideas everywhere. They have no idea what they’re going to do. Repeal is low-hanging fruit. They have done it. They have done it 60 times. They will do it 60 more. They have no plan.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields, David Brooks, thank you both.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And that brings us to the analysis of Shields and Brooks. That is syndicated columnist Mark Shields and New York Times columnist David Brooks.

Happy new year, gentlemen.

MARK SHIELDS: Happy new year, Judy.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Good seeing you in 2017.

So, let’s start by talking about this intelligence report.

Mark, the entire intelligence community is behind it. They’re saying without a shadow of a doubt, in so many words, they are confident the Russians tried to interfere in the U.S. election and they developed a clear preference for Donald Trump.

What are we to make of this? Does it change the way we look at this election?

MARK SHIELDS: I don’t know if it changes the way we look at it, Judy. It certainly changes the way we look at the United States’ relationship with Russia, I think, and in this sense, that the intelligence community said it made these findings with high confidence.

Ever since the weapons of mass destruction era and the decision on invading Iraq, the intelligence community has been very, very careful to avoid high confidence. That’s saying, we really believe this to be true. They have been more tentative.

There was no question. They were unequivocal and emphatic. Every American ought to be angry, ought to be concerned that an unfriendly nation, a nation that has cooperated with us certain places, but doesn’t wish us well, sought to sabotage American democracy, American confidence in our own democratic institutions, and to influence the outcome of the election.

That’s a cause of concern and worry and anger. And I would hope that we would respond, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans, to make sure it never happens again.

JUDY WOODRUFF: David, how should Americans look at this?

DAVID BROOKS: I agree with that, with anger, with shock.

We have sort of gotten used to the idea, because of the news leaks before this report. But the idea that Russia felt emboldened and apparently fearless to go into our election and manipulate our own election process, whether successfully or not, is a sign that they are outside the norms of normal society.

There’s always statecraft. There’s always disinformation. But this is a step up, a Russia that feels completely free to do this, a Putin who feels completely free to do this, without fear of penalty, and so far paying little penalty.

Partly, it’s motivated, I think, by animus toward Hillary Clinton, as we heard earlier in the program, things she said in 2011, 2012, partly, frankly, a desire, a belief that feeling Donald Trump will be tougher on ISIS.

But the thing that should most concern us is a shift in American foreign policy. We have had a bipartisan belief in American foreign policy based on the post-World War II institutions that believed in democratic global world, which Russia and the Soviet Union was often seen as hostile to. And most Republicans and Democrats have always basically believed in this world order.

Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and maybe Marine Le Pen do not agree with this basic structure of the world. They seem to have no respect for the institutions that were created after World War II, and they see a potential alliance of populists around the world who would fight Islam and restore a certain semblance of traditional values.

And so we could be seeing a pivot in American foreign policy that may be on the mind of Donald Trump, certainly seems to be on the mind of Steve Bannon, his ideologist. And this is a piece of that larger shift.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, Donald Trump, the president-elect, does have his own reaction to this report.

His disparagement, make that disdain, openly, for the American intelligence community and its work is damaging to national security. I mean, the intelligence community, for the security of our nation, for the well-being of our nation, for the economic prosperity of our nation, competitiveness, depends on sources in other places.

And other nations depend upon our intelligence. And here we have the president-elect dismissing, disparaging, disdaining openly because it somehow, in his way — his perspective, diminishes his victory, is just astonishing.

DAVID BROOKS: The policies of the Democratic Party have always been in cultural consonance with the culture of the working class. And, somehow, they missed that. And I thought he was very honest.

But also on the part of the interview — you saw a man who has been in governance, as he said, since he was 27. And when you’re in governance, you understand the limitations and the complexities of governance. It’s hard.

And on Obamacare, I’m not sure the Trump administration has thought in any complex way about how to repeal and replace. Repealing first and then replacing later doesn’t strike me — and a lot of the Republican health care experts I talk to — doesn’t strike them as just a workable thing to do.

You repeal some of the things, like maybe the — some of the premium supports that are in Obamacare, and then you replace it with something later, that seems likely in the short term to create exactly the sort of death spiral and destabilization that we’re all worried about.

And so it seems to me and it seems to a growing number of Republican senators, including Bob Corker and John McCain, that you have got to repeal and replace at the same time. You have to have a plan, or else you’re just creating a recipe for chaos.

And it’s not clear how much either the House leadership or the Trump administration has thought that through how exactly how it’s going to work.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Just 10 seconds, Mark. We will be watching.

MARK SHIELDS: What’s the big rush, Judy? What’s the big rush on the health care plan?

It’s been eight years. So they have had a lot of ideas. I mean, Paul Ryan said that. They have got ideas everywhere. They have no idea what they’re going to do. Repeal is low-hanging fruit. They have done it. They have done it 60 times. They will do it 60 more. They have no plan.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields, David Brooks, thank you both.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And that brings us to the analysis of Shields and Brooks. That is syndicated columnist Mark Shields and New York Times columnist David Brooks.

Happy new year, gentlemen.

MARK SHIELDS: Happy new year, Judy.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Good seeing you in 2017.

So, let’s start by talking about this intelligence report.

Mark, the entire intelligence community is behind it. They’re saying without a shadow of a doubt, in so many words, they are confident the Russians tried to interfere in the U.S. election and they developed a clear preference for Donald Trump.

What are we to make of this? Does it change the way we look at this election?

MARK SHIELDS: I don’t know if it changes the way we look at it, Judy. It certainly changes the way we look at the United States’ relationship with Russia, I think, and in this sense, that the intelligence community said it made these findings with high confidence.

Ever since the weapons of mass destruction era and the decision on invading Iraq, the intelligence community has been very, very careful to avoid high confidence. That’s saying, we really believe this to be true. They have been more tentative.

There was no question. They were unequivocal and emphatic. Every American ought to be angry, ought to be concerned that an unfriendly nation, a nation that has cooperated with us certain places, but doesn’t wish us well, sought to sabotage American democracy, American confidence in our own democratic institutions, and to influence the outcome of the election.

That’s a cause of concern and worry and anger. And I would hope that we would respond, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans, to make sure it never happens again.

JUDY WOODRUFF: David, how should Americans look at this?

DAVID BROOKS: I agree with that, with anger, with shock.

We have sort of gotten used to the idea, because of the news leaks before this report. But the idea that Russia felt emboldened and apparently fearless to go into our election and manipulate our own election process, whether successfully or not, is a sign that they are outside the norms of normal society.

There’s always statecraft. There’s always disinformation. But this is a step up, a Russia that feels completely free to do this, a Putin who feels completely free to do this, without fear of penalty, and so far paying little penalty.

Partly, it’s motivated, I think, by animus toward Hillary Clinton, as we heard earlier in the program, things she said in 2011, 2012, partly, frankly, a desire, a belief that feeling Donald Trump will be tougher on ISIS.

But the thing that should most concern us is a shift in American foreign policy. We have had a bipartisan belief in American foreign policy based on the post-World War II institutions that believed in democratic global world, which Russia and the Soviet Union was often seen as hostile to. And most Republicans and Democrats have always basically believed in this world order.

Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and maybe Marine Le Pen do not agree with this basic structure of the world. They seem to have no respect for the institutions that were created after World War II, and they see a potential alliance of populists around the world who would fight Islam and restore a certain semblance of traditional values.

And so we could be seeing a pivot in American foreign policy that may be on the mind of Donald Trump, certainly seems to be on the mind of Steve Bannon, his ideologist. And this is a piece of that larger shift.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, Donald Trump, the president-elect, does have his own reaction to this report.

I mean, you know, joining in with what David’s saying, I mean, he started out by calling it a political witch-hunt. And then after he was briefed about it, he said — he made a very short comment and said, in so many words that, well, it didn’t affect the outcome of the election.

MARK SHIELDS: As usual, he takes the big picture. In other words, I won, and anything that in any way diminishes or tarnishes my personal victory, I reject.

His disparagement, make that disdain, openly, for the American intelligence community and its work is damaging to national security. I mean, the intelligence community, for the security of our nation, for the well-being of our nation, for the economic prosperity of our nation, competitiveness, depends on sources in other places.

And other nations depend upon our intelligence. And here we have the president-elect dismissing, disparaging, disdaining openly because it somehow, in his way — his perspective, diminishes his victory, is just astonishing.

JUDY WOODRUFF: David.

DAVID BROOKS: It’s happening on three levels, like, this story.

There is the big strategic level, which I described. Then there’s the Donald Trump ego level. And his ego is like a comet the size of Jupiter just traveling through the solar system, and we all have to be affected by its gravitational pull. So all of American foreign policy has to remind us that Donald Trump really did win this election all by himself, and nobody else could have helped, and so it was all me, me, me.

And that seems to be the center of his views. And then the third is, this is a guy who’s going to be taking over a public office, presidency of the United States. He is going to have a system built around him. He will have employees.

And he, as a public servant, will work with other public servants, presumably the intelligence community. But he seems completely uninterested in being part of this system which our founders set up. And so he seems to still be a lone wolf insulting his future employees.

And, believe me, woe to you who insults the intelligence community, if you’re president. You do not want to get on their bad side, because, A, they leak a lot. B, you actually need them to learn about the world. And he seems to be on purpose alienating the resources he’s going to have to draw upon.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as we just heard from John Kerry, Mark, the world is a more complicated place than it’s maybe ever been.

He talked about the number of different places that the U.S. now has to worry about its relationship with. And, right now, we’re at this critical point where we’re changing from one administration to the next. It’s always, I guess, a fraught time, but it just seems especially so this time.

MARK SHIELDS: Well, it does, and I think, in part, because of the reasons David announced, observed earlier, that the changing sort of organizing principle of postwar world and the United States. And we know, I think, probably more keenly and more acutely, the limits of our power.

If I could just add one thing to David’s observation earlier. And that is, Judy, I have lived through an awful lot of transitions from an election to inauguration. It is a period during which president-elects follow a pattern. They become more popular. What they do is, they submerge partisanship. They reach across the line. They do all sorts of symbolic things to unite the nation.

This president-elect has done just the opposite. He continued his rallies, apparently for self-gratification. He fired up his true believers. He continued to disparage and belittle his defeated opponent openly.

And toward what end? There’s been no symbolic reach. He’s had interviews, I guess, with Heidi Heitkamp, the Democratic senator from North Dakota. But there’s been no sense of any strategic sense of where the country is going or what it’s about.

Here he is tweeting about Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ratings on “The Apprentice?”

JUDY WOODRUFF: This morning.

MARK SHIELDS: He’s interfering? He’s making 12 calls into Ohio to defeat John Kasich’s Republican state chairman in the Republican state committee vote.

This is pettiness. And this is — this shows just no largeness of vision. And it’s really distressing.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, yesterday, David, in conjunction with this, he tweeted another criticism, I guess, of the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer. He called him the head clown in talking about the way the Democrats are handling Obama.

I did interview the vice president yesterday, who looked right into the camera and said, grow up, Donald.

You know, is that the kind of comment that’s likely to make a difference, do you think?

DAVID BROOKS: The vice president?

JUDY WOODRUFF: The vice president.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I’m sure Donald Trump is growing and maturing as we speak.

You know, I — we have gotten used to analyzing presidential statements in a certain way. Like, what is the policy implications? And we take them all very seriously, because, when a president speaks, as Mark said a couple of weeks ago, that usually means a lot.

But I have come to think we have to treat Donald Trump’s tweets like Snapchat. It’s just something that is going to go away. And it flies out of some region of his brain and it goes out into the ether. And usually it’s on the realm of media.

Even in his tweets of Russia, he was attacking CNN and NBC for their coverage. He’s a media commentator a lot of the time, even with Schwarzenegger. And so it will exist, and it will fill conversation for a moment. And then, like Snapchat, it will just go away.

And so I think, until he can give us something real, it’s sometimes best to just let them go with the wind.

JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when he calls Chuck Schumer the head clown, Mark, we just ignore it, or…

MARK SHIELDS: Judy, what does it help? How does it possibly help? He’s going to need Chuck Schumer.

Chuck Schumer is a proud and able and dedicated and skillful leader, and you don’t want him as an opponent. You don’t want him as a sworn adversary. And he’s a formidable figure legislatively. Why do it? It’s gratuitous.

On the Joe Biden interview, of all sad words of tongue and pen, these are the saddest that might have been. We went through an election where we had the two least-liked nominees in the modern history of American polling.

And you could not watch the interview — and I commend you for it last night — with Joe Biden without saying, I like this guy. I mean, he is a thoroughly likable man. And when he says, grow up, I mean, it wasn’t said — there was nothing mean about it. It was just — it was absolutely what a grownup would say.

This was a grownup talking. And the way I thought he talked about Democratic values was missing in the campaign of 2016, sorely to the Democrats’ disadvantage, it was just a — it was a marvelous — I commend it to anybody who missed it for any reason to watch it online.

JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the things I talked to the vice president about, David, was Obamacare and what the Republicans are going to do about it.

The administration is saying they’re afraid that they can’t make any changes unless they make bad changes to it. What do you see going on with it?

DAVID BROOKS: First, on the interview, I was struck by the way he kept emphasizing the Democrats did not campaign on the dignity of the working class.

MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

DAVID BROOKS: The policies of the Democratic Party have always been in cultural consonance with the culture of the working class. And, somehow, they missed that. And I thought he was very honest.

But also on the part of the interview — you saw a man who has been in governance, as he said, since he was 27. And when you’re in governance, you understand the limitations and the complexities of governance. It’s hard.

And on Obamacare, I’m not sure the Trump administration has thought in any complex way about how to repeal and replace. Repealing first and then replacing later doesn’t strike me — and a lot of the Republican health care experts I talk to — doesn’t strike them as just a workable thing to do.

And so it seems to me and it seems to a growing number of Republican senators, including Bob Corker and John McCain, that you have got to repeal and replace at the same time. You have to have a plan, or else you’re just creating a recipe for chaos.

And it’s not clear how much either the House leadership or the Trump administration has thought that through how exactly how it’s going to work.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Just 10 seconds, Mark. We will be watching.

It’s been eight years. So they have had a lot of ideas. I mean, Paul Ryan said that. They have got ideas everywhere. They have no idea what they’re going to do. Repeal is low-hanging fruit. They have done it. They have done it 60 times. They will do it 60 more. They have no plan.

ROY THOMAS audio excerpt: ""Stan really worked almost every way you could image during the Marvel Era -- except maybe a full script! He did everything from a detailed plot for the early Fantastic Four to a little conversation over the phone for five to 10 minutes to telling somebody, 'Why don't we make Doctor Doom the villain?'"" You can LISTEN to this interview with former Marvel Comics editors ROY THOMAS and DANNY FINGEROTH, co-authors of THE STAN LEE UNIVERSE, by clicking the audio player above!  Order 'Alter Ego: The Best Of The Legendary Comics Fanzine' by clicking on the book cover above! Fingeroth, now a senior VP of education of the Museum of Comic and Comic Art in New York, was a guest on Mr. Media back in 2008 promoting his book, Disguised as Clark Kent: Jews, Comics, and the Creation of the Superhero. As for Thomas, the editor of Alter Ego magazine, I interviewed him for my biography, Will Eisner: A Spirited Life, at the behest of Stan Lee himself. Lee had told me about his exchanges with Eisner, two of which were quite eye-opening.

In the other, he vaguely recalled proposing a humor magazine and asked Eisner to flesh it out. Lee said to talk to Thomas for all the details, which I did.

"The Great Gildersleeve - Gildy Turns Off The Water (09-18-46)","
Gildy Turns Off The Water (Aired September 18, 1946)


The Great Gildersleeve (1941-1957) was the arguable founding father of the spin-off program, as well as one of the first true situation comedies (as opposed to sketch programs) in broadcast history. Hooked around a character who had been a staple on the classic radio hit Fibber McGee and Molly, The Great Gildersleeve enjoyed its greatest period in the 1940s, when Harold Peary graduated the character from the earlier show into the sitcom and in a quartet of likeable feature films at the height of the show's popularity.

THIS EPISODE:

September 18, 1946. ""Gildy Turns Off The Water"" - NBC network. Sponsored by: Kraft Parkay, Pabst-Ett. Gildersleeve decides to turn off the water of the residents who haven't paid their water bill. Bill Kelsey (writer), Earle Ross, Frank Moore (writer), Harold Peary, Jack Meakin (music), John Laing (announcer), Lillian Randolph, Louise Erickson, Richard LeGrand, Shirley Mitchell (?), Walter Tetley. 29:50.

"Inauguration Day, Obamacare, and State Sovereignty","Great show today. Darren and I attended the 5th annual 10th amendment dinner last night and had a great time. I wore my Indochino suit and looked like a million bucks if I do say so myself.

Washinton is planning for large protests of up to 200k people who intend to object and/or disrupt the inauguration of Donald Trump. More than 7,500 national guardsmen have been called up to assist in the security of the event and based on what some protesters are saying it’s probably a good thing they’ll be there.

General Mattis was on Capitol Hill yesterday talking about talking about the threats from Russia and China. I know I may take some heat for my comments, but I found Mattis’s opinion on both Russian aggression and the South China Sea Troubling. I’ll discuss today.

Thanks to all of you who share and subscribe to the show. We’ve got big plans for 2017 and I’m glad you’re a part of them.

"History Bhoys Abroad - Know Your History - St Pauls Celtic","It's 2017 and this is the first podcast of the year from ourselves but also a slight change from our usual offering.

Know Your History is going to be an intermittent podcast from us talking to some Celtic community members about their subtler Celtic moments. These episodes will feature once a month alongside our normal podcasts.

We were joined by Paul Kennedy, known to most as PK, from St Paul's Celtic, an amateur Celtic supporters team based in East London.

We discussed being a Tim in London, St Paul's, his personal Celtic memories and current Celtic thoughts.

"The Non-Pill, Natural Alternative To Viagra That Instantly Fixes Erectile Dysfunction, Boosts Libido In Men & Women, Enhances Orgasm & Much More.","https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/gaines Last month, I hopped on an airplane and flew down to Miami, Florida, where I underwent a special type of protocol that is technically called “extracorporeal shock wave therapy,” also known as “Audio Frequency Shockwave Therapy.” Basically, although the physician on today's podcast will be able to explain the nitty-gritty science behind it, this technique uses mild acoustical waves to “shock” a male or female's genitals either A) back to life in the case of things like low libido, erectile dysfunction or small size or B) turn one into the equivalent of, pardon the expression, a sex machine with more blood flow, bigger size, better orgasms and much more. Let's just say I was pretty pleased with my own personal results, so pleased in fact, that I decided to get the doctor who oversaw my procedure onto a podcast. Whether you're a guy or a girl, if you're interested in enhancing your sex life, building new blood vessels, or fixing libido and sexual issues, this is a must listen. Dr. Richard Gaines, MD, FAARM, ABAARM, is the Chief Medical Officer at an age management medical practice company called HealthGAINS. He is a leading practitioner of the rapidly evolving science of ""physician-guided age management"", and has been administering bioidentical hormone therapy since 1993. After a distinguished thirty-year career as a physician and health-care executive, Dr. Gaines became president and chief medical officer of the age management medical practice HealthGAINS, which he founded in 2005. He graduated from Boston University School of Medicine in 1981, completed his internship at Tufts University School of Medicine and his residency at Harvard Medical School and earned a fellowship in cardiac and obstetric anesthesia at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. He subsequently served as a physician at Huntington Memorial Hospital and as an anesthesiologist at Harvard Community Health Plan and Sheridan Healthcorp. Dr. Gaines is also a member of the following professional organizations: -ACAM – The American College for Advancement in Medicine -A4M – The American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine -IFM – The Institute for Functional Medicine -AMMG – Age Management Medicine Group His professional certifications include: -Fellowship in Anti-Aging and Regenerative Medicine (FAARM) from the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine. -Board certification from the American Board of Anti-Aging & Regenerative Medicine (ABAARM). -Certification as a Functional Medicine Practitioner with advanced training at The Institute for Functional Medicine. Hormone Replacement Therapy Dr. Gaines is a pioneer in the use of hormone replacement therapy, or HRT for both men and women. Before dedicating himself to helping men and women be healthier, happier, and more vital from their 30s to their 40s and beyond through HRT, Dr. Gaines worked as an anesthesiologist. For three decades he was a board certified anesthesiologist at some of the most well-known hospitals in the country, and he maintains that specialty to this day. Most notably related to today's podcast, Dr. Gaines is the creator of something called ""Gaines Enhancement"", which is one of the only drug free, surgery free male enhancement procedures that not only provides effective treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED), but that can also increase both the length and girth of the penis. During our discussion, you'll discover: - The shocking number of guys who take Viagra, Cialis or some other kind of ED med...[10:25] -Aside from the exorbitant cost, are there any known deleterious side effects to Viagra...21:25[] -The fascinating history of the use of sound wave therapy and pulse wave therapy in medicine...[25:45] -How this same technique can be used to significantly decrease risk of heart attack...[31:40] -Whether the GainsWave therapy is any different than a ""pump"" that many men use...[46:00] -The ""P-shot"" and ""O-shot"" that Dr. Gaines injects into the genitals of men and women...[50:55] -How what Dr. Gaines does is any different than a company like, say, Cenegenics does...[52:53] -And much more! Resources from this episode: -The GainsWave website (if you want to go to Miami, Florida and have the protocol done by Dr. Gaines, simply mention this podcast or ""Ben Greenfield"" to save 5% off your entire protocol and any follow-up procedures you decide to get done - from P-shots to sound wave therapy and beyond.)

"193: Natalie Eckdahl on Planning for Profits","Natalie Eckdahl is a business coach, professional facilitator, keynote speaker and host of the Biz Chix Podcast which iTunes ranked a #1 New Business Podcast in March 2014. Natalie has an international coaching practice where she works with female entrepreneurs desiring to grow a profitable business whether they are just starting out or have a million dollar company. She leverages her 20 years of business experience, graduate business degree and social media savvy to help her clients efficiently adapt their business to their family life and individual priorities. She is the busy mom of three children ranging in age from 2-14 and starts her day with a steaming cup of Ethiopian Coffee. 
 Click to tweet: .@bizchixpodcast is sharing her story to inspire you on Women Taking the Lead https://womentakingthelead.com/193 #inspiration
 Playing Small Moment
 When Natalie started her podcast, she thought her show would be an instant hit with the sponsorship to go with it. After a year with lots of expenses and absolutely no revenue, Natalie had to reassess her plan and focus on her niche audience. After a mentor suggestion, Natalie came up with a new plan which has helped her business soar. 
 The Wake Up Call
 In the Fall of 2015, Natalie and her husband sat down and discussed their financial goals for the upcoming year. With a set number of revenue that would be transferred to the family account each month, Natalie would be able to prioritize her expenses while also seeing the rewarding amount she had actually earned. 
 Style of Leadership
 Natalie is confident that just 60 minutes with her in a strategy call, she can help any entrepreneur with their business. Inside that very call, Natalie can become familiar with their current success and how to further develop it.
 What Are You Excited About?
 Natalie is excited about certain trends she discovered this year and has come to really understand the entrepreneurial woman. She is excited to help women profit their business and to see traction build in her own after 3 years. 
 Current Business Challenge
 Not wanting to cut corners, Natalie struggles to find time to create a bigger team she can properly delegate to. This is due to her very busy schedule.  
 Your Support System
 With Natalie’s current struggles of establishing a new team, her husband has agreed to step in to help and be her tech handyman. Natalie also has a mastermind that has helped her along the way.
 Leadership Practice
 A self-proclaimed podcast junkie, Natalie often learns from fellow podcasters through binge listening once she's found a favorite. This auditory practice helps to expand her show and interviewing skill, by exposing herself to a wide ranging set of styles.

 Profit First by Mike Michalowicz
 Advice For Younger Self
 If Natalie had the chance, she would tell her younger self that you can’t plan it all out. “You don’t know where life is going.” She had a whole plan in her 20s, and things have been so pleasantly different. It was through all of the things that weren’t in the plan that made her who she is today.

"Puberty","I have been sitting here in my big, manly, black leather poppa chair in my living room doing these podcasts for quite a while now. Quite a time for me isn't the same as it is for archeologists. My Lady Wonder Wench is interested in archeology, which is good for me, because I am hoping she will get more interested in me as I get older.
  As Big Louie, the Head Guy of our Louie Louie Generation always says, ""Grow old, not dim. If you have any moving parts left, for heaven sake, MOVE EM!"" I realized in the fifth grade, that men and women have different moving parts. When Summer vacation came around in the fourth grade, all the boys and girls were pretty much the same. But in September, and fifth grade started, the girls came back a foot taller, and they had...moving parts. It was like they went to Summer bosom and giggles camp. And the fact that they were a foot taller meant that our eyes were cruelly positioned at bosom level...and we weren't ready for it. Some of us are still not ready for it.

"Fighting The Second Enslavement:  Dr. Martin Luther King and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel","We think of the enslavement of the Israelites in Egypt as “the enslavement,” but didn’t the Egyptians own slaves prior to that (albeit of a different kind)?  I look at a Rashi which places the “enslavement” (or en-serf-ment –same word in Hebrew) of the Egyptians by Joseph as the middle step in two enslavements, first Egypt’s everyday slavery — in the ancient world slavery was the inevitable consequence of unpayable debt– and second the reactive enslavement of the Israelites as the supposed cause of Egypt’s decline.  I see a parallel in American society from our initial enslavement of Africans and African-Americans to our recent reactive blaming of our decline on people of color rather than on our own national debt and lack of future planning.  I make that case while remembering the close relationship of Dr. Martin Luther King and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, as recorded by Heschel’s daughter, Sus [...]

"Iowa basketball's topsy-turvy week, Maryland preview with Jess Settles","Iowa was at two opposite ends of the spectrum last week, beating then-No. 19 Purdue before being blown out at Northwestern.

"Jan Zalasiewicz","Jan Zalasiewicz, Professor of Palaeobiology at Leicester University, talks to Jim al-Khalili about the Anthropocene, the concept that humans now drive much geology on the earth. He's one of the leading lights in the community of scientists who are working to get the Anthropocene, the Age of Man, recognised.

They discuss the controversy about the date of when it began- some say it was a thousand years ago, or the Industrial revolution, others that it was the Second World War, and yet others that it's as recent as the 1960s. It all turns on finding the Golden Spike, a layer in rock strata above which the geology changes.

Jan Zalasiewicz began his career as a traditional geologist studying rocks 500 million years old in Welsh border. After years out in the field mapping the landscape for the British Geological Survey he moved into academia at Leicester University."

"Interval Show #12: Dropping Excess Body Fat","The Primal Endurance podcast Interval shows are published in between our full-length feature episodes published on Fridays. For the Interval episodes, podcast host Brad Kearns discusses various elements of the Primal Endurance approach, pulling from topics in the book/digital course and adding some candid and fresh insights. The Interval shows will keep you focused and purposeful with all of your workouts and lifestyle decisions.
 How fat adapted are you? Well, try skipping breakfast and waiting till you are actually hungry. Then try fasted workouts - can you run 4 miles in the morning without food? or 8 miles? Or bike 25 or 50 miles? You can also get a glucometer and check fasting blood sugar with a simple prick of your finger - check it before and after a workout to see if you can stabilize.
 In contrast, if you are stuck in carb dependency, your mood, appetite, energy level and performance fluctuate according to your meal habits. Don’t forget your body’s hard-wired genetic mechanism to avoid depletion and exhaustion, and consequently overeating. Watch out for commercial energy bars which are almost all high carbs. Don’t even get me started on the hassles of trying to slam down carbs during sustained endurance performance - 60% of Hawaii ironman people have stomach distress.

"EP013: The Sword In The Stone and What’s Stopping You From Getting What You Want","After one of my quarterly mastermind events, that I attend in Laguna Beach, I had a revelation while listening to a friend talk about the full story of King Arthur and the sword in the stone. It’s a story that most people never hear that made me realize why I sometimes get stuck in certain areas in my life. It also gave me insight into why a lot of people never get what they want.

When it comes to reaching any goal, it’s not only important that you surround yourself with people who have achieved what you want to attain. But also equally important to surround yourself with people who you trust and will point out the things you may not see or want to hear. By doing so you will be able to learn from your mistakes then apply change moving forward. Without this type of environment it’s easy to get stuck in a “cup de sac” – spinning circles and wondering why things never change for you.

IN THIS EPISODE YOU’LL LEARN:

  How you can learn from the military “hot wash” – which will teach you how to learn from your mistakes so that failure becomes a stepping stone, and not a roadblock


  What the story of King Arthur and the sword in the stone has to do with breaking through your limitations and ultimately seeing success


  The truth about HOW you get what you want, and why you may be struggling to pull the trigger and take action on the things that you want


  How to avoid living a life of quiet desperation and live up to your standards

"EP013: The Sword In The Stone and What’s Stopping You From Getting What You Want","After one of my quarterly mastermind events, that I attend in Laguna Beach, I had a revelation while listening to a friend talk about the full story of King Arthur and the sword in the stone. It’s a story that most people never hear that made me realize why I sometimes get stuck in certain areas in my life. It also gave me insight into why a lot of people never get what they want.

When it comes to reaching any goal, it’s not only important that you surround yourself with people who have achieved what you want to attain. But also equally important to surround yourself with people who you trust and will point out the things you may not see or want to hear. By doing so you will be able to learn from your mistakes then apply change moving forward. Without this type of environment it’s easy to get stuck in a “cup de sac” – spinning circles and wondering why things never change for you.

IN THIS EPISODE YOU’LL LEARN:

  How you can learn from the military “hot wash” – which will teach you how to learn from your mistakes so that failure becomes a stepping stone, and not a roadblock


  What the story of King Arthur and the sword in the stone has to do with breaking through your limitations and ultimately seeing success


  The truth about HOW you get what you want, and why you may be struggling to pull the trigger and take action on the things that you want


  How to avoid living a life of quiet desperation and live up to your standards

Aviation in 2017: Supersonic jets and premium economy
We look at the value and practicality of supersonic passenger jets. In November, 2016, Boom Technology showed a ⅓-scale prototype of their XB-1 Supersonic Demonstrator called ""Baby Boom."" According to their website, they have “A breakthrough aerodynamic design, state-of-the-art engine technology, and advanced composite materials [to] enable an ultra-fast airliner as efficient and affordable as business class in today's subsonic wide-body airliners.” Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and others are also developing supersonic passenger jets.
FAA Releases Third Class Medical Reform Final Rule
FAA calls the new rule ""BasicMed"" and it becomes effective May 1, 2017. AOPA President and CEO Mark Baker says the rule is, “the best thing to happen to general aviation in decades.” AOPA plans to offer a free online medical course to let pilots comply with the BasicMed rules.

German investigators find only pilot Lubitz at fault in Germanwings crash
German prosecutors have determined that Andreas Lubitz is solely accountable for the Germanwings plane crash in March 2015. Lubitz concealed his illness from his employer and neither doctors, Lufthansa, Germanwings, or the German aviation authority could be held accountable.

Inexperience, weather, and pilot confusion conspired against the chartered Hawker that never reached its destination.
Wi-Fi available on 83% of U.S. airline seats
According to a report by Routehappy, Internet availability on U.S. airlines was 83% in 2016, up from about 74% in 2015. Internet availability on foreign airlines was only 28%. However in many instances, connection speeds are too slow to support video streaming.

"012: Dr. Peter Amlinger: The Principle of Love / Kairos Update: Dr. Brett Jones: The why behind the Cervical Revolution","Dr. Peter Amlinger graduated at the top of his class from CMCC in 1985, and has maintained a family oriented principle based practice in Mississauga since that time.
 Dr. Amlinger speaks regularly internationally and speaks at Dynamic Essentials meetings. Since 2004 he has visited Spain regularly to help the chiropractors organize the profession in that country and was instrumental in the birth of the Barcelona College of Chiropractic.
 He has been nominated for the Canadian Chiropractor of the Year Award three times, and was the recipient of this award in 2006.
 In September of 2004 he started Chiropractic Pure and Powerful, a seminar bringing some
 of the Nation’s best speakers together in an effort to unite chiropractors in the principle. He is also president of Purposeful Living Inc. which is a chiropractic consulting and speaking service.
 In 2005 he was elected to the council of the College of Chiropractors of Ontario, and in 2006 he was elected to the Executive Board of CCO. He was elected President of the College of Chiropractors of Ontario in June 2009 and was re - elected in April 2010 for a second term. He completed another two terms as President of the CCO from April 2012 - April 2014. In April 2012 he was elected Secretary Treasurer of the FCEARB. In December of 2012 he was awarded the Heart and Hands Award by the Ontario Chiropractic Association, an award commemorating Dr Michael Brickman’s contribution to the profession. In August of 2015 he became the regional director of the International Chiropractors Association, Canada.
 Dr. Amlinger sees his role as a teacher as that of facilitating personal growth in chiropractors, their families and their staff so that they can fall in love with the principles of chiropractic, integrate them into their lives, and develop their “ideal practices” from the inside out. He sees the principle as the uniting force in chiropractic and is dedicated to enhancing the understanding and utilization of the principle around the world, and to helping people realize their God given purpose.
 By surrendering to a life of purpose, vision and mission, one awakens their INNATE GIANT within and positions themselves to grasp the BIG IDEA. This opens the door to a life of joy and peace, and ultimately allows one to serve humanity with an attitude of loving, giving and serving, just for the sake of doing so.

 Dr. Amlinger sees his role as a teacher as that of facilitating personal growth in chiropractors, their families and their staff so that they can fall in love with the principles of chiropractic, integrate them into their lives, and develop their “ideal practices” from the inside out. He sees the principle as the uniting force in chiropractic and is dedicated to enhancing the understanding and utilization of the principle around the world, and to helping people realize their God given purpose.
 By surrendering to a life of purpose, vision and mission, one awakens their INNATE GIANT within and positions themselves to grasp the BIG IDEA. This opens the door to a life of joy and peace, and ultimately allows one to serve humanity with an attitude of loving, giving and serving, just for the sake of doing so.

In December of 2012 he was awarded the Heart and Hands Award by the Ontario Chiropractic Association, an award commemorating Dr Michael Brickman’s contribution to the profession. In August of 2015 he became the regional director of the International Chiropractors Association, Canada.

"#34: All About Cardio","In this episode, Eric Helms, Brad Loomis, and Andrea Valdez discuss the methods, mechanics, and purposes of cardiovascular training.
 Because they are all natural bodybuilding coaches, the bulk of this conversation revolves around contest prep athletes and how 3DMJ personally works with them in achieving their fat loss goals. The coaches also touch on how they personally prescribe this type of training to their athletes, in what amounts, and with what types of modalities they prefer competitors to use.
 The coaches also go over a lot of answers to commonly asked questions as well, such high intensity interval training versus low intensity steady state cardio, whether they thing running is a good idea, how they would program cardio for powerlifters, and even how they sometimes use bodyweight and barbells to achieve certain results within the right context for some types of athletes.
 This is a very in-depth and valuable conversation for many different types of lifters. It will cater to those who are looking to make things simpler by reviewing some basic principles, while also catering to those who must do cardio but are bored or stagnant with their current routine and want to find different and appropriate ways to mix it up.

"Episode 59: In Plain Sight","In 1849, abolitionist and attorney Wendell Phillips wrote: ""We should look in vain through the most trying times of our revolutionary history for an incident of courage and noble daring to equal that of the escape of William and Ellen Craft; and future historians and poets would tell this story as one of the most thrilling in the nation's annals, and millions would read it, with admiration of the hero and heroine of the story."" Unfortunately, almost 170 years later, William and Ellen Craft aren't well known anymore. Today, we have the story of this couple's incredible escape.

"11 Physical Challenges to Take This Month","Some people don’t need any help finding physical challenges. They naturally and intuitively figure out ways to engage physically with the world and test their prowess. But that’s not everyone, or else we’d see people sprinting down the street, hurdling park benches, climbing flagpoles, and swinging from tree branch to tree branch. It’d be a cool world, to be sure. It’s just not the one we live in.
 In this world, where physical challenges are usually optional, we have to go looking for them.
 What are some fitness challenges to try? I’ve got 11.

"#15 - Dr. Jon Engel DDS - A Dentist that FOCUSES on true PREVENTION!","Dr Jon Engel DDS is not only an amazing dentist, he’s also a five time CAREERFusion attendee! 
 Today he sits down and tells us why he comes to CAREERFusion, and what he takes back to his team and patients.
 Dr. Engel is unlike any dentist I’ve ever met; he cares deeply for his patients, but he’s also in tune with his emotions.  And, in a perfect world he’d put himself out of business by preventing cavities if it were up to him. 
 Naturally, I picked his brain about the prevention he lives and breathes, and he’s kind enough to give the listeners some great insight about pH control, and how xylitol attacks the mouth bacteria responsible for cavities.
 He opens up about how in the past he used to take it personally when his patients didn’t accept his treatment recommendations, but how he now holds space for people and comes from the place of serving the patient vs. treating them.

Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? 14 I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, 15 so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name. 16 (I did baptize also the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.) 17 For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power."

"Don Brown: The Inventor of The Ab Roller on Gaming Your Core with The Stealth Core Trainer","Don Brown has been inventing fitness equipment since the 1990s.
 He fell in love with fitness in no small part thanks to fitness icon, Jack LaLanne. His first chain of fitness centers was called XERCISE,Inc in Northern NJ. And it was in this gym that one day he ran into a problem with one of his clients.
 Don Brown had always been a problem solver, so when his client who had a neck injury couldn't do a simple crunch without pain, Don knew he needed to create a solution.
 After some thought, Don had a eureka moment when he bent a paper clip into a ""funny"" shape and he knew in that moment how to create his first fitness equipment idea.
 He left work, went to a Home Depot, and built the first prototype for the Ab Roller that day.

 In its first 3 years on the market, The Ab Roller exceeded 100 million dollars in sales. Well over 15 million people have purchased AB Rollers making it one of the most successful consumer fitness products ever.

 Twelve years after he invented the Ab Roller, he co-invented the AB COASTER which quickly became a huge success. You can see these devices in gyms all over the world.

 Don Brown is constantly looking for the next big thing in improving and training your core. That's why when Don's friend came to him with an idea for how to make planks more fun, Don jumped at the idea. And with the same ingenuity of his first device, Don created an early prototype of Stealth.
 Things have changed since the days of The Ab Roller and Ab Coaster. Now, Don can use sites like Kickstarter and IndieGoGo to help fund his new product and get it to the market faster.
 Don joins me on the show to talk about The Stealth Core Trainer which turns your planks into an active, fun, and challenging game you can use on your phone.
  
 In this episode we discuss:

"Your Imagination & Your Abundance","IMAGINATION - Excerpt from Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill

THE WORKSHOP OF THE MIND

The Fifth Step toward Riches





THE imagination is literally the workshop wherein are fashioned all plans created by man. The impulse, the DESIRE, is given shape, form, and ACTION through the aid of the imaginative faculty of the mind.

It has been said that man can create anything which he can imagine.

Of all the ages of civilization, this is the most favorable for the development of the imagination, because it is an age of rapid change. On every hand one may contact stimuli which develop the imagination.

Through the aid of his imaginative faculty, man has discovered, and harnessed, more of Nature's forces during the past fifty years than during the entire history of the human race, previous to that time. He has conquered the air so completely, that the birds are a poor match for him in flying. He has harnessed the ether, and made it serve as a means of instantaneous communication with any part of the world. He has analyzed, and weighed the sun at a distance of millions of miles, and has determined, through the aid of IMAGINATION, the elements of which it consists. He has discovered that his own brain is both a broadcasting, and a receiving station for the vibration of thought, and

p. 127

he is beginning now to learn how to make practical use of this discovery. He has increased the speed of locomotion, until he may now travel at a speed of more than three hundred miles an hour. The time will soon come when a man may breakfast in New York, and lunch in San Francisco.

MAN'S ONLY LIMITATION, within reason, LIES IN HIS DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF HIS IMAGINATION. He has not yet reached the apex of development in the use of his imaginative faculty. He has merely discovered that he has an imagination, and has commenced to use it in a very elementary way."

"Awesome Astronomy - February Sky Guide","Wed 01: Awesome Astronomy - February Sky Guide
 Paul Hill, Ralph Wilkins and Jenifer Millard host. Damien Phillips and John Wildridge produce. A podcast beamed direct from an underground bunker on Mars to promote science, space and astronomy (and enslave Earth if all goes well).
 Summary of content:  What to look out, and up, for in February.
 Our highlights of this month’s skies with the planets on offer to observers and imagers:
 - A last chance look at Mercury in the morning sky
 - Mars a few degrees from Venus
 - Jupiter in Virgo, above Spica.
 - Saturn in the early morning sky
 Next up is the return of a couple of comets to our observing tick list:
 Comet 45P at its best on the 11th February in Hercules
 Comet 2P Encke returns to our skies in the constellation Pisces
 Then we each take a deep sky pick from our list of favourites for this time of year:
 Ralph – the Rosette Nebula and open cluster NGC2244 in the constellation Monoceros
 Paul – open cluster M93 in Puppis.
 Jeni – supernova remnant, Messier 1 – the Crab Nebula - in Taurus
 And we finish this sky guide with February’s moon phases, a conjunction with the Hyades Cluster on the 5th and a penumbral eclipse on 10th/11th February.

"Cathy & Elliot Lewis On Stage - Statement Of Fact (05-14-53)","
Statement Of Fact (Aired May 14, 1953)


A fine actor and voice talent in his own right, Elliott Lewis honed and polished his numerous performance and production skills from the mid-1930s forward for CBS. From his seemingly effortless natural progression from voice talent, to co-starring acting roles, to writing, early directing efforts, and production supervision, at each juncture Elliott Lewis continued to distinguish himself as a rare and versatile talent for CBS. Lewis' early work with Jack Benny and his Jell-O Program established his comedic timing and versatility. This connection would ultimately lead to one of Lewis' most memorable character roles as Remley, in the Phil Harris and Alice Faye Show. As Lewis embarked on his second decade with CBS he was already being promoted as 'Mr. Radio' by CBS' Publicity Department--and for good reason. Indeed, in spite of the early explosion of Television in the 1950s, Elliott Lewis continued to express his preference--very publicly--for Radio as a dramatic medium over Television. Show Notes From The Digital Deli.

THIS EPISODE:

May 14, 1953. CBS network. ""Statement Of Fact"". Sustaining. A good story about an ambitious district attorney and his interview with a woman who has just murdered her husband with a hatchet. Byron Kane, Cathy Lewis, E. Jack Neuman (writer), Elliott Lewis, Frederick Steiner (composer, conductor), George Walsh (announcer), Jack Kruschen, Joan Danton, Joseph Kearns, Ray Noble (theme composer), Truda Marson, Tyler McVey. 29:37. Episode Notes From The Radio Gold Index.

This connection would ultimately lead to one of Lewis' most memorable character roles as Remley, in the Phil Harris and Alice Faye Show. As Lewis embarked on his second decade with CBS he was already being promoted as 'Mr. Radio' by CBS' Publicity Department--and for good reason. Indeed, in spite of the early explosion of Television in the 1950s, Elliott Lewis continued to express his preference--very publicly--for Radio as a dramatic medium over Television. Show Notes From The Digital Deli.

"[Vijay Prashad] Responsibility to Protect","Following the mass killings in Rwanda and the international communities’ failure to act, the UN formulated a new doctrine called Responsibility to Protect (R2P). Its key provision is “Sovereignty no longer exclusively protects states from foreign interference.” Libya is a perfect example of R2P gone haywire. There were hyperbolic reports of atrocities, bloodbaths and massacres. The U.S. invoked R2P. A UN resolution to protect civilians was passed and its authority almost immediately exceeded. NATO embarked on a heavy bombing campaign. R2P quickly morphed into regime change. Qaddafi was assassinated. Hillary Clinton joked, “We came, we saw, he died.” Cheers could be heard in the corridors of power in the West. Today, Libya is a broken, devastated country. R2P, if it is to be effective and have credibility, cannot be selectively applied. Nor can it be used as a cover for big power intervention."

"#249 Nonstop Administration Insurance - David Sloves","As a country, we've started 2017 with a lot more healthcare uncertainty and insecurity than recent years. Costs are rising and the Affordable Care Act remains on the chopping block of many Republicans, leaving those seeking healthcare with high premiums for minimal procedures. So we've invited David Sloves to join us on the show by phone to address some of the concerns facing nonprofits. As CEO of Nonstop Administration & Insurance Services, his aim is to deliver affordable healthcare options to the staff of nonprofits so they can be in good health to do the work they need to do. As he mentions, healthcare for 90% of the population costs less than $1500 per year but our costs are exorbitant across the board because of the costs of the other 10%. His company is an insurance broker and administrator that helps manage these costs for nonprofits and helps save them money so that people working to better our society can take care of themselves and go to the doctor when they're sick without breaking their nonprofit wallets.
 David has developed repeatable, cost-effective solutions to complex business problems for Fortune 500 clients since the 1980’s. He has a strong commitment to human rights, heath care advocacy and environmental awareness. Nonstop deflates the annual costs of employee healthcare through its unique partial self-insurance program, Nonstop Wellness, which allows nonprofits to stabilize the growing costs of premiums, eliminate all employee out-of-pocket expenses, and access unspent reserve funds for unrestricted operating use.

"Home Theater Geeks 343: HPA Tech Retreat 2017","
Entertainment-technology consultants Geoff Tully and Ron Williams, just back from the 2017 HPA (Hollywood Professional Association) Tech Retreat, talk about some of the main topics of discussion at the event. Paramount among them was high dynamic range (HDR), which Geoff addressed in a presentation advocating HDR with 1080p resolution, a concept that broadcasters embrace. Ron discussed the demo he presented with Grass Valley of a live HDR camera signal shown on an SDR monitor and two HDR monitors, illustrating how HDR actually results in greater perceived detail. We also discuss the impending ATSC 3.0 terrestrial broadcasting standard, answers to chat-room questions, and more.

"RCE014: Tim Cook - Building Community as the Raw Londoner","On this week’s show I’m joined by Tim Cook of Raw Londoner. Tim is not just a raw foodie; he’s into plant-based food as well. He loves to mix science and research with intuition, which is just the perfect blend. Science teaches us so much and is so important, but there are just some things that science is yet to prove. There’s an energetic quality of food that we discuss in today’s episode, which is difficult to measure, scientifically.
 In this episode, Tim shares about creating a community around what you do, especially when you drastically change your lifestyle. We dive into his tips on how he created his community and how you can start to create one for yourself as well. I love his approach to the raw food lifestyle and how he takes bits and pieces from the movements that others have started and applies it to his own life. I hope you enjoy this episode and are inspired by Tim’s motivation to live a healthy life. 
 What You’ll Hear in This Episode:
  Tim shares his story, the mission surrounding Raw Londoner and how it came about. Hear Tim’s tips on finding a community or tribe to support you in your raw lifestyle. Discover how Tim first got started on his nutrition journey towards raw foods. Understand why Tim pursued a plant based diet to live a long, healthy life. Learn why pulling specific portions from other’s ideas and adapting them to your life is key. Find out why nutrition is still a developing science with a long way to go. Discover the benefits of letting yourself have the thing that you can’t see yourself giving up. Tim shares his definition of superfoods and how it relates to your body’s needs. Hear Tim’s favorite superfoods, and what he has in his collection. And so much more!  More About This Episode:
 For Tim, the single most important thing is to be happy and to genuinely, deeply, feel good. He chooses the nutrition he does to give him a long and healthy life, filled with energy, vitality, strength, mental clarity, and a great physique. A plant based diet is something that Tim chose because it felt great. He eats a high percentage of his diet raw and with minimal processing. This ensures that it is in its freshest, most natural state with maximum nutrition.
 Tim is most interested in the science of nutrition and also believes that our bodies are far more sophisticated devices than our current science understands. Our thoughts and emotions have a much greater impact than we currently understand, scientifically. Tim is highly involved in the folklore of plant based health and believes that although there is little research, folklore can often guide us to what works even if it can’t explain the mechanics behind it.
 He is also interested in the intuitive approaches to plant based health because he believes we have a greater spiritual connection that’s cheering for us to live the greatest version of our lives possible and is always giving us guidance whenever we listen. We are all responsible for the greatness of own our life. For Tim, he is doing the best he can to live the greatest life.

"What Happens When We Don’t Believe the President’s Oath?","     Yesterday, Just Security and the Center on Law and Security at New York University School of Law hosted Benjamin Wittes for a conversation on a question he and I have posed about the path of the Trump presidency so far: what happens when we can’t take the president’s oath of office seriously?
 Ben’s talk focused on an essay by him and myself that went up on Lawfare simultaneously, in which we argued that the presidential oath—little discussed though it may be in constitutional jurisprudence and academic literature—is actually the glue that holds together many of our assumptions about how government functions. And when large enough numbers of people cause to doubt the sincerity of the president’s oath, those assumptions begin to crumble.
 Many thanks to Ryan Goodman of Just Security and Zachary Goldman of the Center on Law and Security for putting together this event. Make sure to also read Ryan’s Just Security followup post on his post-talk discussion with Ben and the questions raised by our essay.

Driverless Car Project Waymo has filed a federal injunction to stop Uber's self-driving research. The documents filed are part of a case we reported last month that involves Google's claim that Uber stole Waymo's designs for LIDAR, a key technology of the driverless car.
Google is looking to make things a bit less annoying for humans by making CAPTCHAs invisible. Google isn't sharing the secret sauce, but the company says its system no longer needs your help recognizing when you are a human, and when you might be a robot posing as a human. THEY ALREADY KNOW.
Facebook is testing a new feature that will remind you to finish videos that you started watching. Facebook is testing the continue-watching feature only on the web version of Facebook right now.
We also discuss drones that shouldn't hurt when they fall on your head and how one man bred a snake with emoji on its skin. Plus, Sam Abuelsamid from the Wheel Bearings Podcast tells us everything we need to know about the uncertain future of vehicle-to-vehicle communication in driverless cars.

 Sensing Murder is a New Zealand television show in which three psychics are asked to act as psychic detectives to help provide evidence that might be useful in solving famous unsolved murder cases by communicating with the deceased victims. So far no help from the psycics has been forthcoming.
 We talk to Mark Honeychruch, the Chair of the NZ Skeptics about the return of this lamentable show.

"Ep. 189 - Hampton Court Palace","Hampton Court Palace located in the London suburb town of Hampton, dates back to medieval times. Throughout the centuries, the palace has been expanded to the point that it has become two palaces in one. The first is a Tudor Palace that was transformed by both Cardinal Wolsey and then King Henry VIII and a baroque castle that was built by William and Mary. The interior decor has changed to suit the occupants, who have ranged from knights to cardinals to kings and queens. What has been left behind, makes Hampton Court a museum of history. Spirits have been left behind as well. Join us and our listener Amanda Prouty as we explore the history and haunting experiences, one of which is hers, of Hampton Court Palace. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Tim Scott and features a light bulb that has burned since 1901 and This Month in History features Nelson's Pillar blown up by IRA.

We discuss what a judge said and what his mother did to make Casanova finally reconsider his ways, what music got him through a seven year bid, and how all these years later, he came to find out that his friend from inside jail went on to become A$AP Rocky. We talk gambling, investing, joining the construction union, raising his son and daughter, and the circumstances that led him to make his smash song Don't Run, which caught the attention of Taxstone, Chris Brown, Memphis Bleek, Meek Mill, Fabolous, Kevin Hart and more!"

"2 Reasons to NEVER go Live on Social Media","Welcome to episode 340 of Hit the Mic with The Stacey Harris.
 Hello hello. We're going to talk about something I have been using to grow my community this year and something that you really need to be using. We alluded to this in the ""3 Things You Must Know"" episode last week, but we're going to dive in deeper, and it's going live.
 First thing I want you to know, going live doesn't have to be a certain place, a certain frequency, a certain length of time. Going live might look different for each one of you. For me right now, it has really meant using Facebook Live. My community is there, my audience is there, my attention is there honestly. It's been kind of a no brainer for me to use that.
 Then disperse that content in the other places, meaning that Facebook Live episode can go up on YouTube. I can share snippets of it in my story on Instagram and Snapchat. I can really break that out; I can share that YouTube video on Twitter and LinkedIn. I really can use that Facebook Live content in all of the places.
 There are some tools that will let you to go live in multiple places, I have not found one yet that I find reliable and quality enough to share with you and give a recommendation. Stayed tuned, I am on the hunt for something like that.
 For me, and honestly for a lot of you listening; the great entry point, a great place to get started, a great place to just start taking action is going to be Facebook Live. It really is a simple, simple way to go live. So do it, go live.
 I want to talk a little bit about the two big objections I get to going live because I see these all the time when I'm talking to clients, or we're talking in the membership community about how to go live and if you should do it. I want to combat these two big pushbacks. Number one; it doesn't have to be brand new content and it doesn't have to be content that exists only in that Facebook Live, or YouTube Live, or Periscope, or Instagram Live or whatever.
 Repurpose this stuff guys. Use your most popular blog posts as a great way to get started on doing video. Break those tips down into a series of videos, and then use that call to action to point them back to the full blog post on the website. You know your audience is interested in that, or it wouldn't be your most popular blog post. See what I'm saying?
 A great way that I have been doing this is taking pieces of trainings, or webinars, or podcast content and just repurposing that into video. By repurposing it, I mean really, really simply saying, ""Hey, here's a little chunk of this content. If you want more, go over here."" Sometimes that's join us at Hit the Mic Backstage. Sometimes that's join us on the podcast, sometimes that's go read this blog post. Whatever it is; it's taking a piece of something I've already created and presenting it in a new way.
 The big value point for this guys, is that not only is it a time saver for us, and you've heard me sing the praises of repurposing enough times that I don't need to do that; on the flip side of that, you're going to allow that content to reach a whole new audience, to reach some people who maybe prefer video or happen to be tuned in and just didn't see that blog post or that podcast.
 You're giving it to them in another way so that they can connect with it, so they can get what they need. I say this all the time, but it's our job to get them from problem to solution. If you're not getting them from problem to solution, you're not doing your job guys.
 Repurposing our content really allows us to present something in a way that's going to connect with them. Honestly, maybe they read the blog post, they listened to the podcast, but this time is the time that makes the difference. Maybe it's because there's the face to face feel with video. Maybe it's because of the timing; it could honestly be a hundred different things. What again is important is that it connects. Push past this idea that you have to create another thing, that you have to do something else. It's not necessary.
 The other piece of feedback I get, the other little bit of pushback I get to going live, and where I want to spend the bulk of our time today is talking about the tech. I get that it can feel scary if this is something that you have not done before and you're a tiny bit tech-phobic, as I know some of you are.
 It's literally never been easier to create video for your business. A; live is pretty forgiving, especially since most of us can do it from our smart phones, which by the way have pretty decent little cameras on them these days. Up until like maybe a month ago, six weeks ago, it was the nicest camera I'd ever owned, I was on my iPhone 6s Plus.
 I do now have a separate camera that I use for pre-recorded video that's a little nicer than my iPhone, but honestly not that much nicer than my iPhone. Don't underestimate the value of your iPhone camera or if you have an Android, your Android camera. Your smart phone camera is pretty damned good.
 In the case of Facebook, and in the case of, YouTube's rolling this out for the mobile app; Twitter, now you can go live from the Twitter app, you don't even need the Periscope app anymore guys. You can use your already existing Twitter app. You open it up and you hit go live. Same with your Facebook, same with Instagram. Literally all the places and all you need is your phone.
 If you want to go super techy you can add a stand, you can add a little tripod. I actually have one and I'll put the link in the comments, I'm sorry in the resources section of the show notes. I actually have a little, I don't know, I think this thing is four inches tall. It's got a little bracket on the top of it that holds my iPhone. It's got bendy legs that I can hang it around things and hold it if I want to. Again, set this up on your desk, go live. There's not a big tech barrier.
 Now if you want to go a little more pro, if you want to do something a little more advanced; that's also totally possible. I use a tool called OBS, it allows me to stream from my desktop into Facebook. Some of you may very well have already noticed that Facebook is letting you go live right from your desktop. Again, the barrier to entry is not high here.
 I like to use OBS though because I can do some kind of advanced things. I keep it pretty simple. I'll be honest, I don't do any super high end production stuff just because I want my focus to be on the content and providing value to you. In the spirit of full transparency, it's also because that's not my forte.
 I have simple things, but it allows me to really quickly, and seamlessly, and semi-attractively move between maybe a solid photo that's up in the pre-show, to me on camera, to my desktop and me, or just my desktop; that I can really move pretty quickly into showing you guys something on my computer if I want to be doing that, or again, talking to the viewers face to face if I want to be doing that. That's why I like OBS.
 The other cool thing with OBS is I'm able to schedule a Facebook Live in advance right through Facebook. If you want to know more about using OBS and scheduling Facebook Live and things like that, I actually just released, at the beginning of this a month, a brand new training all about going live inside of Hit the Mic Backstage. We do an OBS walkthrough, and we talk about scheduling Facebook Live and all of that stuff in that training. That would be the place to go to get a handle on that tech.
 There you go, I just lowered that barrier to entry for you too. It does not have to be complicated, it does not have to mean a super crazy studio, and built-in stuff, and lights, and cameras, and a permanent structure as part of your office. It can mean that, it 100% can mean that. If that is what you want to do, do it. Don't let having to have that stop you from doing anything.
 In fact, right now grab your iPhone, go live and put together proof of concept. Make sure that this is going to be something that A; you're going to actually do because you're going to be really upset you spent thousands of dollars building in this whole live studio when you never go live on Facebook, or Twitter, or YouTube, or Instagram, or anything, so start going live.
 Also, I find the best way to figure out exactly what it is I'm going to need tech and gear wise is to start doing whatever it is I'm going to do. In many, many cases I have discovered once I started doing something that I needed something that I didn't think of. Even more often than that, I find that I didn't need something I thought ""I had to have"". Anybody with me? Everybody sort of shamelessly raise your hands, because I know I'm not alone on that one.
 That's it, that's what I wanted to talk about because it really is, it's been a big part of what I've done. We've shifted this year into doing just one podcast episode a week, and in that it's not that I'm actually creating less content, it's that I'm creating different content. That's because, for the first now, what is it 10 weeks, 8 weeks of this year; since the beginning of January, I have gone live once per week minimum.
 There have been a couple of times where I've gone live more often than that because we've done challenges; we did the podcasting challenge in January, we did the Facebook ads challenge in February. During both of those weeks I went live four times in a week instead of just once per week, which was super fun but I'll be honest, not something I'm going to commit to doing all of the time, but it was a really good time.
 Just start doing it guys, because it has, it's been a really powerful piece for my engagement. It's been a really great driver into Hit the Mic Backstage. It's also been a really great traffic driver to my email list. I found going live on my page as part of the challenges really grew the traffic for those challenges during the challenge.
 The ads were obviously done because we're in the challenge, but I found my list increasing each day I went live because people were seeing live and finding out about the challenge. Maybe they had heard about it but they had forgotten to sign up, or they had heard about it and went, ""Eh, I don't know."" Then they saw a video and they were like, ""Dude, I'm totally in"" and signed up.
 I'm seeing the growth, I'm seeing the numbers and I want you to see them too. Don't let tech and don't let fear that you have to create something else prevent you from doing this. All right, you deserve it, your audience deserves it, and your social media and your community numbers will thank you and will grow.
 We're going to talk a little bit about live later in the month too, so say tuned. In two weeks I'm going to talk about some of the mistakes I've made and lessons I've learned. Make sure that you check that out. Actually no, I'm totally lying to you; that's next week. In two weeks we're go into a social media tool review, so stay tuned for that too, all right.
 Also, every Thursday, usually on Thursdays ... Okay, it's been on Thursdays always but I know for a fact it's going to be on a Tuesday coming up, that's why I'm saying usually, just in the sake of full transparency guys. Once a week you will find me live on Facebook, Facebook.com/TheStaceyHarris. If you haven't followed me yet, go ahead and like that page, that's where you'll find me. Of course, if you would rather watch the replay on YouTube you can do that; YouTube.com/TheStaceyHarris.
 Guess what guys, the best place to connect with me, the best place to find out information like this way sooner than you're going to get it here because I'm in there all the time; Hit the Mic Backstage. If you haven't joined us yet, fix that. It is the next step after this podcast to get even more value, even more information, and you know what? A little accountability to take actions, because you've invested and you're spending the time there. If you tell me you're going to do something, I'm going to ask you if you did it.
 Come join us at Hitthemicbackstage.com and I will see you backstage.

"SS 280: Sharing & Oversharing: Putting Our Sex Lives on Stage with Lucas Brooks & Kinky Jean","After seven years of podcasting, it's rather shocking to us how much we put of our lives out into the ether. A podcast can be very much like a living document in that way. What compels us to share so much of ourselves? Probably some narcissism, but also an innate belief that personal information breeds empathy and understanding. Tonight we talk about sharing and oversharing with Cooper, Dylan, Dirty Lola, Mike Joseph, Kinky Jean, and Lucas Brooks to talk about putting our lives out in the open, out on stage.

"HTG 345: Rooms, Speakers, and EQ Curves","
Paul Hales, founder of Pro Audio Technology, talks about room correction—or as he prefers to call it, room compensation. Topics include some of his fundamental principles of room EQ, sound directivity from various objects such as violins and speakers, how microphones do not capture sound in the same way that human ears do, how sound interacts with small to medium-sized rooms, target response curves (including the X-curve), how conforming to the X-curve causes the sound to be louder and more harsh than it should be, his suggested modification to the X-curve, answers to chat-room questions, and more.

"Episode 10 with John Leventhal","My guest today is Mr. John Leventhal. John is a guitarist, songwriter and producer, having won 5 Grammys  and 16 nominations for records he has produced. (I may be incorrect about this, it might actually be more…) 

 As usual on the Riff Raff, I have “selfish” ulterior motives and tend to interview people who were influential to me as a guitarist/producer and John is at the top of that list. He was a big influence on the way I approach working with singers and in the studio. His uncoventional approachs to folk, country and rock/pop genres is hard to pin down and that’s exactly why I like his sound so much. 

John is married to Roseanne Cash,  an amazing singer/songwriter and the daughter of country legend Johnny Cash. (For this interview I get to play one of Johnny Cash’s guitars!) 

In this interview we discuss guitars, producing, working with singers, songwriting, alternate tunings, his early career, “letting go” of preconceived ideas, the importance of good time, and much more. We also do quite a bit of playing and you get to hear John do his thing. There is some really great gems at the end so if you are a fan of John's we were really just getting going....

This interview took place on a snowy day at John’s studio in New York City, March 2017.

"#78: The Millionaire Mindset, 6-Figure Flipping & Wealth Beyond Dollars with Matt Aitchison","''How do I become wealthy and healthy in all areas of my life?'' - Matt Aitchison
 Do you ever feel like you’re living unintentionally? Are your actions in line with your values? Maybe you’re wealthy in one area of life, but completely bankrupt in another?
 These are the big questions that today’s guest, Matt Aitchison was faced with before he found purpose, redefined wealth, and created a life beyond what he ever thought was possible.
 Today, Matt is a millennial entrepreneur, 7-figure real estate investor, and wealth building mentor who has had great success following his turbulent start. After being expelled his senior year of high school, to later facing felony charges in college - when all hope seemed to be lost - Matt decided that his past would not equal his future. 
 He committed to personal development and leading an intentional life, and since graduating from UC Santa Barbara has gone on to found and participate in multiple companies within the real estate, construction, and education spaces. 
 Matt has been ranked in the Wall Street Journal Top 1000 for real estate teams nationwide, personally flipped over 100+ houses in 5 years, hosts a top ranked motivational podcast called  Millionaire Mindcast, and now passionately mentors others on increasing their income, impact, and influence through both one-on-one coaching and his real estate flipping course, 6 Figure Flipper.
 During this energetic convo, you'll get to hear my good buddy ""Matty A."" share his journey and the defining moments leading up to his success. We talk about all kinds of cool topics, including building a legacy, redefining what it means to be wealthy, why finding your purpose is an evolutionary process, the mindset tool that allowed him to level up, and A LOT more! 
 Here’s a quick breakdown of our chat…
  [08:15] Find out how Matt is helping other people, just like you, build wealth through real estate investing! [12:42] What legacy means to Matt and why it’s not just about the tangible assets he leaves behind. [13:43] The defining moment that led to his success AND how it’s completely prepared him to face anything that life throws his way. [23:40] Wealth beyond dollars and finding true happiness by redefining what it means to be rich! [28:31] Why is money important to you and how much is really enough?  [34:26] The importance of determining your intentions before you go after any goal. [39:00] Unpacking the disciplines, habits, and principles from the world’s most successful Millionaires. [42:53] The life-long pursuit of finding your purpose. [48:31] Discover the millionaire mindset tool that has allowed Matt and other busy entrepreneurs to level up in life! [54:56] Giving yourself permission to unplug, disconnect… and maybe even binge watch a little Netflix.  Enjoying the show?

"#78: The Millionaire Mindset, 6-Figure Flipping & Wealth Beyond Dollars with Matt Aitchison","''How do I become wealthy and healthy in all areas of my life?'' - Matt Aitchison
 Do you ever feel like you’re living unintentionally? Are your actions in line with your values? Maybe you’re wealthy in one area of life, but completely bankrupt in another?
 These are the big questions that today’s guest, Matt Aitchison was faced with before he found purpose, redefined wealth, and created a life beyond what he ever thought was possible.
 Today, Matt is a millennial entrepreneur, 7-figure real estate investor, and wealth building mentor who has had great success following his turbulent start. After being expelled his senior year of high school, to later facing felony charges in college - when all hope seemed to be lost - Matt decided that his past would not equal his future. 
 He committed to personal development and leading an intentional life, and since graduating from UC Santa Barbara has gone on to found and participate in multiple companies within the real estate, construction, and education spaces. 
 Matt has been ranked in the Wall Street Journal Top 1000 for real estate teams nationwide, personally flipped over 100+ houses in 5 years, hosts a top ranked motivational podcast called  Millionaire Mindcast, and now passionately mentors others on increasing their income, impact, and influence through both one-on-one coaching and his real estate flipping course, 6 Figure Flipper.
 During this energetic convo, you'll get to hear my good buddy ""Matty A."" share his journey and the defining moments leading up to his success. We talk about all kinds of cool topics, including building a legacy, redefining what it means to be wealthy, why finding your purpose is an evolutionary process, the mindset tool that allowed him to level up, and A LOT more! 
 Here’s a quick breakdown of our chat…
  [08:15] Find out how Matt is helping other people, just like you, build wealth through real estate investing! [12:42] What legacy means to Matt and why it’s not just about the tangible assets he leaves behind. [13:43] The defining moment that led to his success AND how it’s completely prepared him to face anything that life throws his way. [23:40] Wealth beyond dollars and finding true happiness by redefining what it means to be rich! [28:31] Why is money important to you and how much is really enough?  [34:26] The importance of determining your intentions before you go after any goal. [39:00] Unpacking the disciplines, habits, and principles from the world’s most successful Millionaires. [42:53] The life-long pursuit of finding your purpose. [48:31] Discover the millionaire mindset tool that has allowed Matt and other busy entrepreneurs to level up in life!

"Ep. 220 - Matt Mullenweg: Do You Have Your Own Internal ""Code""","I have a rule. After every podcast, I write down 10 things I learned. I don't know if anyone else does this. Do you do this? Some people make illustrations. They send me what they've learned. It's a creation of a creation of a creation. A drawing of a podcast of someone's life.   But I broke my rule. It's been over a month. And my brain is digging for the lessons from my interview with the creator of Wordpress. I think I have Alzheimer’s. Matt was 19 years old when he started Wordpress. It was 2003. Now Wordpress.com gets more traffic than Amazon.com.   The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times both use Wordpress. I use Wordpress.   I wanted to know if it’s still worth the time and effort to make your own site. He said it is. That’s how you break out...   ""We're trying to revitalize the independent web,” Matt Mullenweg said. He’s 33 now. ""It's not like these big sites are going anywhere. They're fantastic. I use all of them, but you want balance. You need your own site that belongs to you... like your own home on the Internet.""   This is part of Matt’s code. Not Wordpress’s “code.” Matt’s like a robot. I mean that as a compliment. There are many signs of this: language, ability, he’s very exact.   I had to interrupt. He was talking in code. And it was my job to translate.   He said, ""If I send you a unit of work...”   ""I don't mean to interrupt,” I said. “I'm a little bit of an interrupter. So I apologize in advance, but you talk in a very code-like language… 'a unit of work.’ How about ‘a task?’ That works as well.""   He laughed. And thanked me for translating. The podcast continued.   He told me about his personal code (again, robot).   People have values. Geniuses and other advanced forms of life  have “code.” So here’s Matt’s...  A) Measure what’s important to you.   Matt wrote a birthday blog. He does this every year to measure what’s changed. It lists how many books he’s read over the past year, countries he traveled to and so on.   He’s very specific.   It’s a measurement of his personal freedom. He can see where time went. And if he chose himself. “You cannot change what you don’t measure,” Matt said.   So this year, I wrote a birthday blog.  B) Own the work you do ""Other sites provide space,” he said. “They provide distribution in exchange for owning all of your stuff. You can't leave Facebook or Twitter and take all of your followers with you.""   That’s why he recommends having your own website. It’s yours. Not Facebook’s. Not Business Insider’s or Huffington Post’s. It’s yours.   When I first started jamesaltucher.com, I picked a template, posted a blog, shared a link on Twitter and within 3-4 minutes I had traffic.  C) Ignore concern Matt dropped out of college and moved to San Francisco when he was 20.   “Were your parents upset?”   “They’ve always been supportive,” he said. “But they were concerned.”   That didn’t stop him. He had direction. And when you know where you’re going, you don’t ask for directions.   Sometimes I feel like I’m driving with the wrong address in my GPS. And Siri won’t stop re-routing.   So what I learned from Matt: Reroute yourself as many times as it takes. Reinvent.   Put someone else’s concern for your wellbeing on your gratitude list. But don’t let it stop you. Don’t let it get in the way of your code.  D) The myth of loyalty When Matt moved and started his first job, he made more than his dad did.   “I got an amazing salary,” he said.   I kept wondering if his parents were upset. I don’t know why.   “Were they upset?”   He said no. Again. But then he explained. “Learning spreads organically.” And when he moved, it helped spark possibility for his dad.   “He worked at the same company for 26 or 27 years. He more than doubled his salary when he left. It made me so sad. I never want anyone to be in the situation my dad was in,” he said. “He gave the loyalty of decades and they didn’t return that loyalty…”   Why? Because they were following a different code. The “employee code” is not the same as the “employer code.”   I don’t measure much. I try to let my life float by. And I hope to help people feel free enough to live by their own codes too. Like Matt and his dad.   That’s how I measure what’s important to me. Am I supportive? Of myself and of others? If yes, then I’m a mix of creation and evolution. Robot and human.   Code and DNA."

Boarding House Doublecross (Aired March 30, 1954)


Rocky Fortune appeared on NBC for only a short run of 25 or 26 shows. The lead character, who goes by the name of Rocky Fortune but whose real name is Rocko Fortunato, was played by Frank Sinatra. Rocky, always ready with a wise remark, seems to be a magnet for trouble, most often with the variety of odd jobs he takes. There is frequently a beautiful woman involved, some good girls, some bad. Rocky's a tough guy who stays just inside of the law but we get an occasional glimpse of a soft heart beneath the hard exterior. It's a character that Mr. Sinatra plays nicely. Employed or not, Rocky possesed a variety of skills. During the course of the series, he worked as a process server, museum tour guide, cabbie, bodyguard, chauffeur, truck driver, social director for a Catskills resort and a carny.

Watch Video | Listen to the Audio
HARI SREENIVASAN, PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND ANCHOR:  Last week, the Senate voted to overturn Internet privacy rules that were designed to prevent Internet providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T from sharing your browsing data, history, financial, health, communication and location information without your explicit permission.  Providers are looking to sell that data to advertisers.  The House has yet to weigh in, but consumer groups oppose the move citing privacy concerns.

For some insight, I’m joined now by “Recode” reporter Tony Romm, who’s been following the story.

First, thanks for joining us.

And so, the Senate’s passed it.  That means the House is going to consider it next.  I kind of gave a rough explanation, but do us a favor.  And what are these rules?  What’s at stake?

TONY ROMM, RECODE REPORTER:  Sure and thanks for having me.

These privacy rules are about as good as dead.  You know, you have to rewind the clock a bit to the last administration to understand how we got to where we are now.  The FCC under chairman Tom Wheeler, an appointee from President Barack Obama, put in place rules the require Internet providers like Comcast and Verizon and AT&T to ask your permission, to ask customers permission before they share their personal information with third parties, advertisers included.

Democrats at the time felt that Internet service providers just had too great a look into your private life and could do myriad things with that information possibly against your will.  But Republicans didn’t like it.  Republicans at the time voted against those rules.  They found them burdensome.  They felt the FCC was reaching far beyond its mandate under law.

And what we’re seeing now is an evolution of that.  Republicans on Capitol Hill voted as you said in the Senate, just last week, 50 to 48, largely along party lines, to gut those rules.  The House is expected to vote this week and you can pretty much expect them to do te same as the Senate, setting us this up to head to the trash heap.

SREENIVASAN:  OK.  So, these rules were designed — I mean, one of the concerns that the industry has and they push back, and say, listen, it’s not fair for me Comcast or AT&T, not to able to do the things that Facebook and Google already do, which is sell that user data.

ROMM:  Absolutely, that’s the argument that those Internet providers made to the FCC and they made in Congress with a very expensive lobbying campaign, saying that they just felt they were being subjected to stronger rules than a Google or a Facebook or a Microsoft, and what-have-you.  That being said, Internet providers have a much different look at you and your personal information than some of these tech companies.  If you don’t like Google, for example, you can just go use Bing.

But if, you know, Comcast is your Internet provider and they’re able to see the totality of your web history, they can get different insights from you, greater insights from you that they can then sell to advertisers.  That’s why you had consumer groups, whether it was the ACLU and folks on Capitol Hill, mostly Democrats, who said this was just too much, and it was time for privacy rules.  Unfortunately, in their case, these rules aren’t staying on the books.

SREENIVASAN:  You know, I remember searching for a piece of luggage once, and then all a sudden, I saw ads from luggage for a week and a half, right?

ROMM:  Yes.

SREENIVASAN:  Everywhere I went, every website.  So, one of the things that the industry always says, well, this is just to try to tailor it so that you find more relevant advertising.

But what other uses are there for this information besides that luggage example?

ROMM:  Sure, not even just relevant information, in terms of the ads you’re seeing.  It’s also to pay for the services that most customers don’t want to pay for.  You know, they don’t want to pay for a service like a Facebook or a Twitter, not that those companies are looking necessarily to charge you.  But the reason so much of the Internet is free is because you are paying for it in a different way and that’s in the form of your personal information.

But, really, we’re just at the beginning of this.  Wireless companies, for example, are looking for new and creative ways to advertise and to monetize users’ information to help their balance sheet.  That’s why Verizon went out and purchased Yahoo.  Now, that’s a deal that’s kind of in a bit of trouble right now given the cyber attack on Yahoo recently, and all the reports of it, rather.

But, you know, that was one example of the kinds of things that these companies would like to do.  They would like to get more information from you and to begin to serve you more and different kinds of advertising, whether it’s relevant, based on your interest, or something else entirely.

SREENIVASAN:  All right.  Tony Romm of “Recode” — thanks so much for joining us.

ROMM:  Thanks for having me.
